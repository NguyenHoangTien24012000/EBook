        <h1>Preface</h1>
        
        <p>The world is driven by connections—from financial and communication systems to social and biological processes. Revealing the meaning behind these connections drives breakthroughs across industries in areas such as identifying fraud rings and optimizing recommendations to evaluating the strength of a group and predicting cascading failures.</p>
        
        <p>As connectedness continues to accelerate, it’s not surprising that interest in graph algorithms has exploded because they are based on mathematics explicitly developed to gain insights from the relationships between data. Graph analytics can uncover the workings of intricate systems and networks at massive scales—for any organization.</p>
        
        <p>We are passionate about the utility and importance of graph analytics as well as the joy of uncovering the inner workings of complex scenarios. Until recently, adopting graph analytics required significant expertise and determination, because tools and integrations were difficult and few knew how to apply graph algorithms to their quandaries. It is our goal to help change this. We wrote this book to help organizations better leverage graph analytics so that they can make new discoveries and develop intelligent solutions faster.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What’s in This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46681383296728">
        <h1>What’s in This Book</h1>
        
        <p>This book is a practical guide to getting started with graph algorithms for developers and data scientists who have experience using Apache Spark™ or Neo4j. Although our algorithm examples utilize the Spark and Neo4j platforms, this book will also be helpful for understanding more general graph concepts, regardless of your choice of graph technologies.</p>
        
        <p>The first two chapters provide an introduction to graph analytics, algorithms, and theory. The third chapter briefly covers the platforms used in this book before we dive into three chapters focusing on classic graph algorithms: pathfinding, centrality, and community detection. We wrap up the book with two chapters showing how graph algorithms are used within workflows: one for general analysis and one for machine learning.</p>
        
        <p>At the beginning of each category of algorithms, there is a reference table to help you quickly jump to the relevant algorithm. For each algorithm, you’ll find:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>An explanation of what the algorithm does</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Use cases for the algorithm and references to where you can learn more</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Example code providing concrete ways to use the algorithm in Spark, Neo4j, or both</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
