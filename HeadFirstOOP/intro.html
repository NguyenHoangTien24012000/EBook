To get the most from this book, or <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> content.</p><p>The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being.

The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span>, so I suppose it must be.”</p><p>The faster way is to do <span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>anything that increases brain activity,</em></span></strong></span> especially different <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <span class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p><p>A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <span class="emphasis"><em>care</em></span> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p><p>But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Here’s what WE did"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="hereapostrophes_what_we_did">Here’s what WE did</h2></div></div></div><p>We used <span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>pictures</em></span></strong></span>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> worth 1,024 words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text <span class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00016a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00016"></a><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:0596008678/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2068719.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="368" height="174"></div></div><p>We used <span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>redundancy</em></span></strong></span>, saying the same thing in <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> ways and with different media types, and <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple senses</em></span>, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p><p>We used concepts and pictures in <span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>unexpected</em></span></strong></span> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> <span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>emotional</em></span></strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions.

You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were reading about it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Listen to your brain.</strong></span></p><p>Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Feel</em></span> something!</strong></span></p><p>Your brain needs to know that this <span class="emphasis"><em>matters</em></span>. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is <span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> better than feeling nothing at all.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Design</em></span> something!</strong></span></p><p>Apply what you read to something new you’re designing, or rework an older project. Just do <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> to get some experience beyond the exercises and activities in this book. All you need is a problem to solve... a problem that might benefit from one or more techniques that we talk about.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Read Me"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="read_me">Read Me</h2></div></div></div><p>This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out everything that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We assume you are familiar with Java.</strong></span></p><p>It would take an entire book to teach you Java (in fact, that’s exactly what it took: <span class="emphasis"><em>Head First Java</em></span>). We chose to focus this book on analysis and design, so the chapters are written with the assumption that you know the basics of Java. When intermediate or advanced concepts come up, they’re taught as if they might be totally new to you, though.</p><p>If you’re completely new to Java, or coming to this book from a C# or C++ background, we strongly recommend you turn to the back of the book and read <a class="xref" href="apb.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Welcome to Objectville: Speaking the Language of OO">Appendix&nbsp;B</a> before going on. That appendix has some intro material that will help you start this book off on the right foot.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We only use Java 5 when we have to.</strong></span></p><p>Java 5.0 introduces a lot of new features to the Java language, ranging from generics to parameterized types to enumerated types to the <span class="strong"><strong><code class="literal">foreach</code></strong></span> looping construct. Since many professional programmers are just moving to Java 5, we didn’t want you getting hung up on new syntax while you’re trying to learn about OOA&amp;D. In most cases, we stuck with pre-Java 5 syntax. The only exception is in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Well-Designed Apps Rock: Great Software Begins Here">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>, when we needed an enumerated type—and we explained enums in that section in some detail.</p><p>If you’re new to Java 5, you should have no trouble with any of the code examples. If you’re already comfortable with Java 5, then you will get a few compiler warnings about unchecked and unsafe operations, due to our lack of typed collections, but you should be able to update the code for Java 5 on your own quite easily.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The activities are NOT optional.</strong></span></p><p>The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some will help you apply what you’ve learned. <span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Don’t skip the exercises.</em></span></strong></span> The crossword puzzles are the only things you don’t <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to do, but they’re good for giving your brain a chance to think about the words and terms you’ve been learning in a different context.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The redundancy is intentional and important.</strong></span></p><p>One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> get it. And we want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about <span class="emphasis"><em>learning</em></span>, so you’ll see some of the same concepts come up more than once.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The examples are as lean as possible.</strong></span></p><p>Our readers tell us that it’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of an example looking for the two lines they need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown within the smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and simple. Don’t expect all of the examples to be robust, or even complete—they are written specifically for learning, and aren’t always fully-functional.</p><p>In some cases, we haven’t included all of the import statements needed, but we assume that if you’re a Java programmer, you know that <span class="strong"><strong><code class="literal">ArrayList</code></strong></span> is in <span class="strong"><strong><code class="literal">java.util</code></strong></span>, for example. If the imports are not part of the normal core J2SE API, we mention it. We’ve also placed all the source code on the web so you can download it. You’ll find it at <code class="literal">http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfoo/</code>.</p><p>Also, for the sake of focusing on the learning side of the code, we did not put our classes into packages (in other words, they’re all in the Java default package). We don’t recommend this in the real world, and when you download the code examples from this book, you’ll find that all classes <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> in packages.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The ‘Brain Power’ exercises don’t have answers.</strong></span></p><p>For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning experience of the Brain Power activities is for you to decide if and when your answers are right. In some of the Brain Power exercises you will find hints to point you in the right direction.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Technical Team"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="technical_team">The Technical Team</h2></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00022a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00022"></a><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:0596008678/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2068731.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="593" height="358"></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Technical Reviewers:</em></span></strong></span></p><p>Huge thanks to our amazing trio of technical reviewers. These guys caught mistakes that we missed, let us know when we were moving too fast (or too slow), and even let us know when our jokes sucked. Several times, they turned chapters around in a matter of hours... we’re not sure if that means they’re really helpful, or need to get away from software development a little more. <span class="strong"><strong>Hannibal</strong></span> in particular made our week when he let us know that the big OOA&amp;D arrow in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;The OOA&amp;D Lifecycle: Putting It All Together">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> was “Hot!” Thanks guys, this book wouldn’t be nearly as solid without your hard work.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates:</em></span></strong></span></p><p>We continue to be amazed at the insight and expertise that <span class="strong"><strong>Bert Bates</strong></span> has about cliffs, and that <span class="strong"><strong>Kathy Sierra</strong></span> has about dog doors. If that doesn’t make much sense, don’t be surprised—everything you know about almost everything gets turned on its head when you meet this pair, and yet we all came out much for the better because of their help.</p><p>Bert and Kathy did a ton of review at the eleventh hour, and we’re thankful they did. Their help and guidance continues to be the heart of Head First.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00023a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00023"></a><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:0596008678/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2068733.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="370" height="260"></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Acknowledgements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>My co-authors:</em></span></strong></span></p><p>Because I’m doing the typing, I get to step out of “we” mode for a moment and say thanks to my co-authors, <span class="strong"><strong>Dave West</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Gary Pollice</strong></span>. Neither of these guys knew what they were signing up for when they came on board, but I’ve never been so impressed by a couple of guys willing to explain, defend, and even change their opinions and knowledge about software design, requirements and analysis, and lift shafts. They were simply incredible, writing up until the very last day, and even got me to relax and laugh until I cried on several occasions.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Our editor:</em></span></strong></span></p><p>This book wouldn’t be in your hands if not for <span class="strong"><strong>Mary O’Brien</strong></span>. I think it’s fair to say she fought more battles and paved the way for us to work without interruption more times than any of us really are aware of. Most importantly, she made this the single most enjoyable project we’ve worked on in our careers. Frankly, she kicked our asses a number of times, and it made all the difference. She really doesn’t realize how much of an effect she has on the people she works with, because we don’t tell her enough how much we respect her and value her opinions. So there, now you know, Mary. If we could put your name on the cover, we would (oh, wait... we did!).</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00024a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00024"></a><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:0596008678/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2068735.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="243" height="218"></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>The O’Reilly team:</em></span></strong></span></p><p>These books are a team effort, never more so than on this one. <span class="strong"><strong>Mike Hendrickson</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Laurie Petrycki</strong></span> oversaw this project at various times, and took heated phone calls more than once. <span class="strong"><strong>Sanders Kleinfeld</strong></span> cut his Head First teeth on this project, and managed to come out alive; better yet, he did a great job, improving the book, and we all are excited that this is just the first of many Head First books he’ll be working on. <span class="strong"><strong>Mike Loukides</strong></span> found Bert and Kathy way back when, and <span class="strong"><strong>Tim O’Reilly</strong></span> had the foresight to turn their crazy idea into a series.

Lou pulled several 12- and 14-hour days to help us with graphics in this book, and put together the amazing Objectville Subway Map in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;The OOA&amp;D Lifecycle: Putting It All Together">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.

It’s hard to know what to say in these situations, especially because Laura has really become the backbone of O’Reilly in many ways. Laura, we are thinking and praying for you and your family, and we wish you all the very, very best in the days to come. We know you’d want nothing more than to see everyone at O’Reilly working harder than ever while you’re away.</p><p>This book is certainly a testament to the people at O’Reilly continuing to deliver, and in many of our conversations, your name came up as someone we wanted to support, and not let down in any way. Your effect on this company is extraordinary, and O’Reilly and the Head First series will all be much better for the day you can return to us in full swing.</p></div></section></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:0596008678/files/core.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
