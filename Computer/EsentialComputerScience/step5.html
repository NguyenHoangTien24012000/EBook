Computers need to talk to each other to enable communication with other systems to enable higher-value services. When we talk about a set of computers communicating over a network, we are describing a distributed system. In this chapter, we will discuss how this happens.</p><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1"><h2 class="Heading">History and Evolution of Networks and the Internet</h2><p class="Para" id="Par3">Since the beginning of electronic computers, humans have had the desire to connect them. The US Department of Defense ARPANET was one of the earliest networks. By 1971, ARPANET was a 15-node network.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Roberts and Merrill proposed a common “messaging protocol” for heterogeneous computers to have a common language for sharing messages. <span id="ITerm1">Heterogeneous networks</span> are defined as being made up of different computers, from different vendors. Wesley Clark, another researcher at ARPANET, proposed a two-layer approach, of an interface layer and a communications layer. Hosts would provide the user interface, initiate the connection, and maintain the connection. And a communications layer of <span id="ITerm2">Interface Message Processors (IMPs)</span> would move the data through the subnets to other hosts.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">IMPs would break messages from the host into 8096-bit packets. A packet can be thought of as an envelope; it is a discrete set of bits that contain the message, or part of a message. A packet header contains the routing information and can be thought of as the address on the envelope. The IMP protocol added a common header that included source, destination, and control information. Routing is determining where to send a packet, so that it arrives at its proper destination. In IMPs, routing to the destination was not done by a central router; rather, each IMP kept a table of the routes with the amount of time it takes to send one of these packets. To ensure the arrival of the packets, an acknowledgement message was sent from the receiving IMP, and a checksum was used to verify the data was uncorrupted. If, after a certain period of time, the packet was not acknowledged, it would be sent again.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">By 1971, a third layer had been added to the network stack, now application, host, and communications. Also, by 1971, the first application, a remote login program called <span id="ITerm3">telnet</span>, was generally available. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and email were soon added and generally available by 1972. In the spring of 1972, ARPANET was demonstrated for the first time at the first <span id="ITerm4">International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)</span>. The ARPANET that was demonstrated in 1972 was not the Internet though. It was a single network of 15 computers with one killer app in the form of email. What was learned in the development of ARPANET, however, led to the creation of the Internet.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">Robert Kahn extended the work from ARPANET to see if the techniques could be applied to radio for both terrestrial transmission and satellite transmission. The biggest impact of this research was applied to local area networks.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8"><span id="ITerm5">ARPANET</span> typically used leased phone lines to connect from computer to computer; however, in Hawaii, the phone lines were too noisy for clean data transmission. So ALOHAnet used radio to transmit the packets. <span id="ITerm6">ALOHAnet</span> used two radio channels: one for machine data and one for user data. As you can imagine, without knowing when a transmission would be received, it was likely that two systems would transmit at the same time and collide with each other. It was impossible to know when to transmit to avoid a collision on the channel. ALOHAnet provided an elegant solution by not trying to avoid collisions. Recognizing that collisions would occur, the ALOHAnet researchers created an algorithm that would select a random time to wait and retransmit.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">Robert Metcalfe improved on this algorithm with subsequent transmission collisions that would increase the random wait time exponentially to back off of a congested channel. Metcalfe applied this radio transmission technique to transmission on wires. Where transmitting data over radio at the time could carry thousands of bits per second, the transmissions over wires could transmit millions. Transmitting data on wires with this technique was named Ethernet.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm7">Ethernet</span> became the standard for data transmission for a <span id="ITerm8">local area network (LAN)</span>. By 1982, Ethernet products were commercially available for personal computers.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Robert Kahn and Vincent Cerf, both computer science researchers on ARPANET, created the Internet architecture. The Internet architecture was more flexible and more distributed than the architecture of ARPANET. The Internet architecture was adopted by not only the Internet itself but many other networks.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">In 1973, Vincent Cerf organized a seminar to design the Internet host protocol, the <span id="ITerm9">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</span>. Cerf and Kahn asked the questions what would be the best protocol for unreliable networks and what would be the best way to connect different networks. Both Cerf and Metcalfe, as well as Gerard Le Lann, collaborated on TCP; as a result, TCP reflected the Ethernet protocol. TCP would be able to handle collisions and out-of-order packet reception. The second question of how to connect different networks had two possible answers. The first possible answer was to continue doing what had been done, which is let each network have its own protocol and then translate between protocols at the network edge. Cerf and Khan realized this would not scale as the number of networks grew, so they pushed for the second possible answer, to have a common protocol, TCP. The advantages of a common protocol, such as a common address space and transparency of the network boundaries, were worth the cost of needing to upgrade legacy networks.</p><p class="Para" id="Par13">To connect to other LANs and potentially translate between different network protocols, Cerf proposed a special kind of computer called a <span id="ITerm10">gateway</span>. A gateway would be connected to two or more networks, and those gateways would maintain routing tables between the networks. This allows the local networks to connect to other networks and eventually be part of the Internet without having total knowledge of the Internet.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">TCP required that all packets were reliably delivered, but this was not needed in every case. In some cases, for instance, if you are broadcasting a message out to lots of subscribers and don’t care if they get it or not, an unreliable protocol makes more sense. As such, in 1978, Vincent Cerf, Jon Postel, and Dan Cohen proposed that TCP was split into two protocols, TCP and IP. TCP was still responsible for reliable delivery, and IP was for simply passing packets between machines. This reduced the complexity of gateways, because they now only needed to handle IP.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">By the end of the 1970s, TCP/IP had been developed and by the early 1980s had become a de facto standard for computer-to-computer communication. At the time, it was not the only standard floating around. A group of public telephone companies and communication equipment manufacturers had developed a standard called X.25 that largely overlapped with TCP/IP. X.25 varied from TCP/IP in that it defined network switching nodes to make virtual circuits between computers during the communication sessions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">Many in the community saw that X.25 was in direct competition with TCP/IP and a threat to open networks. Both network protocols were used during this period, with commercial networks using X.25, while the ARPA Internet used TCP/IP and private networks used a mix of X.25 and TCP/IP. While the debate about how to connect these disparate networks continued, the <span id="ITerm11">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</span> was focusing on computer manufacturers. To help keep the emerging network standards open, ISO created the Open Systems Interconnection <span id="ITerm12">(OSI)</span> project.</p><div class="Para" id="Par17">Because networking computers were still new, ISO did not want to specify specific protocols or standards. Instead, they provided a standard model for creating network models. ISO based their model on the layering scheme that had been created by ARPANET. The OSI model consists of seven layers: physical, link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">5-1</a></span>). The layering scheme allowed ISO standards for network protocols to be slotted into the appropriate layer. A side effect of this layered approach to the network model was that it shaped the thinking of network protocols.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.jpg" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="width:35.62em" width="1425" height="767"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-1</span><p class="SimplePara">OSI Layered Model Showing Layers Used for Connection</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par18">Throughout the 1980s, the Internet grew from a small set of networks mostly related to defense research to an enormous network of computers and users. The Internet was transferred from military to civilian control. At the same time, the personal computer revolution was happening. One growing capability of personal computers was the ability to connect to other users through dial-up modems and <span id="ITerm13">bulletin board systems (BBSs)</span>. BBSs were sometimes connected to FidoNet, a network of bulletin board systems.</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the <span id="ITerm14">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</span> and the <span id="ITerm15">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</span>. This was the beginning of the World Wide Web as we know it. In 1993, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina created a graphical user interface web browser for the <span id="ITerm16">National Center of Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</span> called <span id="ITerm17">Mosaic</span>. The Mosaic client used HTTP to connect to servers on the Internet to download and display HTML content. Web browsers have continued to evolve as one of the primary clients of the Internet Protocols.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">The <span id="ITerm18">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</span> was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, with a mission to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by defining protocols and guidelines to ensure long-term growth of the Web.</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading">Protocols: Stateful and Stateless</h2><p class="Para" id="Par21"><span id="ITerm19">Protocols</span> are the language used to communicate between computing systems on a network called nodes. The protocols carry the information about the connection as well as the content. Protocols define the rules of how to communicate between nodes. The protocol algorithm defines the rules such as who speaks next and what is expected. A protocol is implemented by a header containing the required data and an algorithm that utilizes that data.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22"><span id="ITerm20">Network protocols</span> can be either stateful or stateless. <span id="ITerm21">Stateful protocols</span> keep track of the connection between the two nodes as part of the protocol data itself. <span id="ITerm22">Stateless protocols</span> do not track the state in the protocol, so, in general, there is no relation from one message to the next. There are advantages to both types of protocols, as we discuss in the following.</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading">Internet Protocol (IP): TCP and UDP</h2><div class="Para" id="Par23">The Internet <span id="ITerm23">Protocol</span> suite handles the connections between the host systems on the Internet, covering the transport and network levels in the OSI model. The <span id="ITerm24">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</span> is used for connection-oriented data traffic. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used for connectionless data traffic. Connectionless data traffic is data that is sent but not guaranteed to be received by another node. We will describe why this is done in the UDP section. The underlying Internet Protocol (IP) provides the methods to instruct and route the traffic on the network. The current version of IP is IPv6; however, IPv4 is still in heavy use. One of the key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is the available addressable space in the IP address. IPv4 has 32-bit IP addresses with both the source and destination host addresses and has a 20-byte header (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">5-2</a></span>). IPv6 has 128-bit IP addresses, again with both source and destination, and has a 40-byte header (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">5-3</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig2"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO2"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png" style="width:35.52em" width="1421" height="271"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-2</span><p class="SimplePara">IPv4 Header (32 Bits per Row)</p></div></figcaption></figure><figure class="Figure" id="Fig3"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO3"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png" style="width:35.52em" width="1421" height="217"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-3</span><p class="SimplePara">IPv6 Header (32 Bits per Row)</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class="Para" id="Par24">The Transmission Control <span id="ITerm25">Protocol</span>, TCP, sits on top of IP (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">5-4</a></span>). TCP is the same regardless of whether it uses IPv4 or IPv6. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol in that it provides a byte stream for user processes that is both full duplex and reliable. TCP is reliable because it guarantees the data is sequenced and can be reassembled in the same order it was sent. Many of the most common application protocols such as FTP, HTTP, and ISMP sit on top of TCP. TCP provides features like acknowledgement and timeouts to increase reliability. TCP is also full duplex, which means that data can simultaneously be sent and received by both endpoints on a single connection. TCP keeps track of state information such as the sequence numbers of the message segments.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig4"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO4"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig4_HTML.png" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig4_HTML.png" style="width:35.52em" width="1421" height="134"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-4</span><p class="SimplePara">TCP Header (32 Bits per Row)</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class="Para" id="Par25">TCP defines a connection algorithm that is illustrated in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">5-5</a></span>. First, a client will send a <span id="ITerm26">synchronization (SYN)</span> message to the server with a sequence number (j). If and when that is received by the server, the server will send both its own synchronization (SYN) with a sequence number (k) and an <span id="ITerm27">acknowledgement (ACK)</span> with the client’s sequence number increased (j+1). Finally, if and when the client receives this message, it will respond back with an acknowledgement (ACK) with the server’s sequence number increased (k+1). Once this handshake is done, then the client and server are connected and can communicate.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig5"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO5"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig5_HTML.jpg" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig5_HTML.jpg" style="width:15em" width="600" height="1334"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-5</span><p class="SimplePara">TCP Connect and Disconnect</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par26">When the client is done communicating with the server, it can terminate the connection by sending a <span id="ITerm28">finish (FIN) message</span> and sequence number (m).

Finally, the client responds with an acknowledgement (ACK) of the server’s finish message, after which the client and server are not connected.</p><div class="Para" id="Par27">UDP or the User Datagram <span id="ITerm29">Protocol</span> is the other part of the Internet Protocol suite. Unlike TCP, UDP is a connectionless protocol; this means that UDP can send a message to multiple receivers without disconnecting from one receiver (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">5-6</a></span>). This also means that there is no formal relationship between the senders and receivers, so receipt of the data is not guaranteed. UDP is typically used where performance and speed are more important than reliability. UDP messages are often referred to as datagrams. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration <span id="ITerm30">Protocol</span>), RIP (Routing Information Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System) are examples of protocols that are on top of UDP.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig6"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO6"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig6_HTML.png" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig6_HTML.png" style="width:35.52em" width="1421" height="313"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-6</span><p class="SimplePara">UDP Header (32 Bits per Row)</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading">Host, IP Address, MAC Address, Port, Socket</h3><p class="Para" id="Par28">The computers that are the various endpoints in the network are generically referred to as hosts. <span id="ITerm31">Hosts</span> may have one or more physical layer connections to the network such as Ethernet adapters, Wi-Fi cards, or wireless WAN adapters. The link layer is this direct node-to-node connection from a physical connection on one system to a single other system. The MAC (media access <span id="ITerm32">control</span>) address is the link layer address of these physical connections. The MAC address is a unique 48-bit number assigned to each device. With 48 bits, there is an addressable space for over 200 trillion devices on the network. The IEEE manages the assignment of MAC addresses to manufacturers of network equipment to prevent collisions of MAC addresses.</p><div class="Para" id="Par29">One or more IP addresses at the network layer can be assigned to the link layer MAC address. For IPv4, the IP address is a 32-bit number that is typically written as four dot-separated (between each byte) fields with values ranging from 0 to 255. With a 32-bit number, the addressable space is about 4 billion possible IP addresses. With the explosion of the number of hosts on the Internet, especially <span id="ITerm33">Internet of Things (IoT)</span> hosts, this 4 billion number is too small. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit number typically written as eight fields of four hexadecimal (16-bit/2-byte) digits separated by colons. 128 bits provides a sufficiently large address space for the future of the Internet. A loopback IP address represents the device to itself. The loopback addresses are 127.0.0.1 and 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively. <span id="ITerm34">Multiple services</span> or processes can run on the same host concurrently by using either TCP or UDP. Each service listens on a port number, which is a 16-bit number. Each service must have a unique port number to be accessible on a given host. When a client or a peer needs to connect to a particular service or peer, it needs to specify not only the IP address but the port that the service process is listening on.

DNS servers maintain a mapping of domain names or human-understandable addresses to hosts on the Internet and the corresponding IP addresses. A DNS server will respond to a DNS resolution request with the IP address (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">5-7</a></span>). If the DNS server does not have a matching name to IP address, it forwards the request up to a more authoritative DNS server, which may forward the request to other DNS servers.

The remaining interactions between those hosts will be done with IP addresses.</p><div class="Para" id="Par31">DNS names follow a specific set of rules. The names must end in a <span id="ITerm37">top-level domain (TLD)</span> such as .com or .org. Various countries each have top-level domains. Preceding the top-level domain is a subdomain.

This indicates the range of possible IP addresses the host can reach. The network mask is sometimes called the subnet mask because it defines the subnet that the host is part of. A subnet is one or more hosts connected to a router. As an example (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig8">5-8</a></span>), we have two subnets 143.11.38.0/24 and 143.11.40.0/24, where the first 24 bits or three fields of the IP addresses in the subnets will be the same.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig8"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO8"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig8_HTML.jpg" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig8_HTML.jpg" style="width:35.62em" width="1425" height="662"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-8</span><p class="SimplePara">Two <span id="ITerm40">Subnets</span> Connected to a Router</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par35">The DHCP lease time is how long the requesting client will have that IP address before needing to request a new one.

A router does this by forwarding packets from an inbound link to an outbound link. A router uses a forwarding table to determine which outbound link to send the packet, by inspecting the destination IP address in the packet.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">The forwarding table is kept up to date with the current network topology with the <span id="ITerm42">Routing Information Protocol (RIP)</span>. RIP is a UDP with datagrams from other routers and systems. Because RIP is a connectionless UDP, the packets sometimes get lost. This is ok because the routing table will just get updated with the next RIP datagram. RIP provides a distance measurement to a router, by counting how many hops (number of routers it passes through) between the source and destination.</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">Another routing protocol is OSPF (Open Shortest Path <span id="ITerm43">First</span>), which provides information to routers to build a complete map of the network topology, allowing packet forwarding to be based on a shortest path to the destination. OSPF is used by upper-tier Internet Service Providers, ISPs, where RIP is used inside enterprise networks.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The next routing protocol is the Border Gateway Protocol <span id="ITerm44">(BGP)</span>. BGP is used by subnets to advertise that subnet is part of the Internet.</p><div class="Para" id="Par40"><span id="ITerm45">Network Address Translation (NAT)</span> does a similar job to routers of taking incoming packages and sending them out to a specific destination. Private IP addresses are IP addresses that can be used in multiple local area networks without conflicting as they cannot be routed out to the broader Internet. This is typically the type of IP address a DHCP server will serve up. To send and receive packets to and from these private networks, a NAT table is used to associate a private network IP address and port to a public IP address and port. For instance (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig9">5-9</a></span>), you may be running a web server on your private network at 10.0.0.11 on port 80 and an FTP server at 10.0.0.9 on port 22 with NAT to your ISP-assigned address 143.11.38.34. The Internet only sees one device 143.11.38.34 and can send packets to that device. The NAT will inspect the packet it receives at 143.11.38.34 to check the port destination and then forward that packet to one of the two machines on the private network.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig9"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO9"><img alt="../images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig9_HTML.jpg" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484271070/files/images/503707_1_En_5_Chapter/503707_1_En_5_Fig9_HTML.jpg" style="width:35.62em" width="1425" height="796"></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 5-9</span><p class="SimplePara">Typical Network with DHCP and Network Address Translation</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p class="Para" id="Par41">A firewall works similarly to a NAT in that it inspects the incoming packets. Depending on certain criteria, it will either forward that packet or drop it. The destination application and port number are common rules that are set up in firewalls. Other rules include destination IP addresses and hostnames.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">A proxy server is another service similar to a firewall in that it usually is part of the edge of a network before packets are sent out to the broader Internet to help secure your traffic. Even with encryption of the data, with TCP/IP, the headers are not encrypted, so your source and destination IP addresses are exposed. If you want to hide your source address, a proxy service will replace your source address with a proxy address and send it onto the destination. The destination will then respond back to the proxy server, which will reassemble the received packet with the original source address as the destination of the response.</p></section></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec7"><h2 class="Heading">Distributed Systems: Prominent Architectures</h2><p class="Para" id="Par43">Now that we have looked at some of the fundamentals of what makes up a distributed system, let’s look at some of the application architectures that are built on these network configurations.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading">Client Server</h3><p class="Para" id="Par44">A <span id="ITerm46">client-server architecture</span> is one of the oldest and most common architectures you will see on a network.

One of the challenges of a peer-to-peer architecture is discovering the peers. Multicast <span id="ITerm53">DNS</span> or mDNS is one solution to this challenge. Using mDNS, a peer will send DNS information as a multicast UDP datagram on a network to advertise its presence. Other peers will receive this message to discover a peer.

First, the user will start the FTP client on their host machine specifying the FTP server by hostname, for instance, <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="ftp://ftp.example.com"><span class="RefSource"><span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">ftp.example.com</span></span></a></span>. The FTP client will first resolve the hostname to an IP address via DNS. Once the client has the IP address for <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="ftp://ftp.example.com"><span class="RefSource"><span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">ftp.example.com</span></span></a></span>, for instance, 143.11.38.34, the FTP client can create a TCP/IP packet with 143.11.38.34 as the destination and port 21 to designate FTP. This packet gets sent and is received by the first router, which then forwards to the next router and so on until it gets to 143.11.38.34. The FTP server will set up a session for that client and then send a response packet, which will be routed back to the client host. Once the packet is received by the client, it is decoded, and the user is presented with connection information. The user can then log into the FTP server by entering a username and password. The username is sent to the FTP server as one packet, which the FTP server associates with the session, and the password is sent in clear text as a separate packet to the FTP server. Once the FTP server has both the username and password, the user is authenticated. Now the user can send one or more commands to the <span id="ITerm63">FTP</span> server. For the List command, the FTP server will respond with a listing of the files available for download. From here the user can send a Get command to get a specific file. This will open a separate connection to the FTP server on port 22 to receive the requested file. Finally, the user will send the Logout command to terminate the connection. When this packet is received by the FTP server, it “forgets” all of the information for this connection session and sends a connection terminated response back to the FTP client.</p></section><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec13"><h3 class="Heading">The World Wide Web</h3><p class="Para" id="Par54">The modern World Wide <span id="ITerm64">Web</span> is a collection of technologies that deliver a variety of services from video and music to banking and retail. One key technology that makes the modern Web so successful is SSL, the Secure Sockets Layer. SSL provides a method using asynchronous keys to encrypt the HTTP payload of a TCP/IP packet. This includes the HTTP headers and body.</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">For the purpose of simplifying this discussion, we will focus on nonencrypted HTTP (Hypertext Transfer <span id="ITerm65">Protocol</span>) in comparison to FTP.</p><p class="Para" id="Par56">Like FTP, HTTP is a client-server architecture primarily for transferring files. Unlike FTP, HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the server does not keep any state about the client. This means HTTP needs to provide all connection information in each packet.</p><p class="Para" id="Par57">The World Wide Web uses the Uniform Resource Locator <span id="ITerm66">(URL)</span> scheme to describe resources on the Web. This scheme defines the protocol, domain hostname or IP address, port, and path to the file. This scheme looks like this with each item in brackets indicating a parameter to specify: <span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/path/to/file</span>. The protocol we will use for our example will be HTTP. FTP and HTTPS are two other protocols that can be addressed with an URL. HTTPS for HTTP secure is used to address HTTP through the Secure Sockets Layer and FTP for File Transfer Protocol. For our example, we will use the URL <span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional ">http://example.com:80/index.html</span>. This example has HTTP as the protocol, example.com as the hostname, and port 80, which is the default port for HTTP, as the port number. Because we are using the default number for HTTP, we can exclude the port number from the URL.</p><div class="Para" id="Par58">The user opens a browser and enters the URL into the location field. The browser will decode the URL into its component parts. Just like the FTP client, the first thing the browser will do is resolve the hostname to an IP address. It will then create a TCP/IP packet with the IP address associated with example.com and port number equal to 80, the default port for HTTP. Included in this packet is the HTTP command Get and the requested path. Like all TCP/IP packets, this will be forwarded from router to router until it reaches the server. Here is where HTTP is significantly different than FTP. When the HTTP server receives this packet, it will build a response packet including the contents of the file at the path, in our case index.html.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup <span id="ITerm74">Language</span> and was the original intended format to be sent by <span id="ITerm75">HTTP</span>. HTML provides a way of marking up a document into different sections using tags such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;div&gt; for division, the paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;, and many others, as shown in Listing <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#PC1">5-1</a></span>.

The app.html will include a form to ask the user how many files they would like to see as options. JavaScript will connect, get the user input, and then form an HTTP request packet with the URL to the filelist route that includes the number of files to be provided as options. An HTTP request will be sent via the browser to the back-end server. The server will send back a response containing JSON-formatted data that includes the files that the back end selected for options and the URLs for each file in the back end. The front end will then interpret this JSON data and update the form in the browser to show the file options to the user. Then the user will select one of the options, after which the front-end client will build an HTTP request to get the selected file.

The next request could be a request for a number of files, for instance, to the route “filelist/3.” With this request, the back end will parse the value 3 from the path and use that in a pseudo-random selection of three of the files from the disk.

After that we saw some common architectures for distributed systems including client-server and peer-to-peer.
