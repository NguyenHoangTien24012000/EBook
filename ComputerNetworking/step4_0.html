<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; background-color: black; color: wheat;">
    <section data-testid="contentViewer" class="contentViewer--KzjY1"><div class="annotatable--okKet"><div id="book-content"><div class="readerContainer--bZ89H white--bfCci" style="font-size: 1em; max-width: 70ch;"><div id="sbo-rt-content"><h1 class="h1" id="part4"><a id="page_651"></a><strong>P<small>ART</small> IV<br>Current Topics</strong></h1>
        <p class="noindent">Up to this point, this book has focused on problems and solutions. <a href="part4.xhtml#part4">Part IV</a> is a bit different, in that it primarily focuses on some of the newer trends in network engineering:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• What is the virtualization of functions, what does this accomplish in terms of business requirements and usage of networks, and how does virtualizing functions interact with network design and performance?</p>
        <p class="bull">• What is the <em>Internet of Things</em>, and what impacts might this concept have on the design and future of networks?</p>
        <p class="bull">• Cloud is moving from the new and exciting to the normal and operational; what is cloud computing, and how are clouds built?</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Networks are becoming so large that it is becoming difficult for administrators and engineers to actually manage each piece of equipment individually in near real time. How and where do automation and development operations play a role in solving these problems?</p>
        <p class="indent">These chapters are simply overviews of each of these areas; there is not enough space in a book, even of this size, to cover each area in any sort of detail. It is important, then, to pay attention to the “Further Reading” sections at the end of each chapter to find more material to learn about each topic.</p>
        <p class="indent">When reading these chapters, you should focus on understanding and analyzing these technologies and ideas in the framework presented throughout this book. Ultimately, there is nothing really new here in terms of problems solved or solutions <a id="page_652"></a>offered <em>at a technology level</em>. The constraints of the physical world, no matter how deeply buried in logical abstractions, will always impose reality checks on any solution set or design that must be deployed in the real world. Ultimately, you must look for the tradeoffs in design, security, privacy, cost, and fitness to the purpose of the network—complexity cannot be avoided; it can only be moved from one place to another in the network.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you are reading this book after one of the trends in this section have “come and gone,” you should still read these chapters for their ability to make you think about larger scale, hard-to-solve problems. The intent of this book is to be <em>timeless</em>, in that it will still be a useful learning guide and reference 20 years from now (when you are reading this, not when it is being written). While not every component of the future can be found in the past—there are always surprises in technology and ideas—the fundamental building blocks <em>can</em> always be found in the past.</p>
        <p class="indent">The chapters in this part of the book will help you understand how the many pieces considered up to this point can be put together in different ways to make something new. The chapters in this section include:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• <strong><a href="ch25.xhtml#ch25">Chapter 25</a>: <a href="ch25.xhtml#ch25">Disaggregation, Hyperconvergence, and the Changing Network</a></strong>, which considers the application of disaggregation to building networks, and data center fabrics</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26">Chapter 26</a>: <a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26">The Case for Network Automation</a></strong>, which considers network automation and Development Operations</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch27.xhtml#ch27">Chapter 27</a>: <a href="ch27.xhtml#ch27">Virtualized Network Functions</a></strong>, which considers Network Function Virtualization, Service Chaining, and scale out service design</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch28.xhtml#ch28">Chapter 28</a>: <a href="ch28.xhtml#ch28">Cloud Computing Concepts and Challenges</a></strong>, which considers the business drivers, tradeoffs, and challenges in moving processing to public cloud services</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch29.xhtml#ch29">Chapter 29</a>: <a href="ch29.xhtml#ch29">The Internet of Things</a></strong>, which considers the widespread deployment of sensors and other “things” attached to the Internet, and the challenges and possible solutions resulting from this movement</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch30.xhtml#ch30">Chapter 30</a>: <a href="ch30.xhtml#ch30">Looking Forward</a></strong>, which considers the future of network engineering, including some further thoughts on network automation, block-chains, and named data networking</p>
