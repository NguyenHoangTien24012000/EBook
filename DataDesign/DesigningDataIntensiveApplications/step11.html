        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> we discussed batch processing—techniques that read a set of files as input and
        produce a new set of output files. The output is a form of <em>derived data</em>; that is, a dataset that
        can be recreated by running the batch process again if necessary. We saw how this simple but
        powerful idea can be used to create search indexes, recommendation systems, analytics, and more.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bounded datasets" data-seealso="batch processing" id="idm45085101168624"></a>
        However, one big assumption remained throughout <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>: namely, that the input is bounded—i.e., of a
        known and finite size—so the batch process knows when it has finished reading its input. For
        example, the sorting operation that is central to MapReduce must read its entire input before it can
        start producing output: it could happen that the very last input record is the one with the lowest
        key, and thus needs to be the very first output record, so starting the output early is not an
        option.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="unbounded datasets" data-seealso="streams" id="idm45085101166000"></a>
        In reality, a lot of data is unbounded because it arrives gradually over time: your users produced
        data yesterday and today, and they will continue to produce more data tomorrow. Unless you go out of
        business, this process never ends, and so the dataset is never “complete” in any meaningful way
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Akidau2015gh-marker" href="ch11.html#Akidau2015gh">1</a>].
        Thus, batch processors must artificially divide the data into chunks of fixed duration: for example,
        processing a day’s worth of data at the end of every day, or processing an hour’s worth of data at
        the end of every hour.</p>
        
        <p>The problem with daily batch processes is that changes in the input are only reflected in the output
        a day later, which is too slow for many impatient users. To reduce the delay, we can run the
        processing more frequently—say, processing a second’s worth of data at the end of every second—or
        even continuously, abandoning the fixed time slices entirely and simply processing every event as it
        happens. That is the idea behind <em>stream processing</em>.</p>

        In general, a “stream” refers to data that is incrementally made available over time. The concept
        appears in many places: in the <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> of Unix, programming languages (lazy lists)
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Abelson1996ut-marker" href="ch11.html#Abelson1996ut">2</a>],
        filesystem APIs (such as Java’s <code>FileInputStream</code>), TCP connections, delivering audio and video over
        the internet, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>In this chapter we will look at <em>event streams</em> as a data management mechanism: the unbounded,
        incrementally processed counterpart to the batch data we saw in the
        <span class="keep-together">last chapter</span>. We will first discuss how streams are
        represented, stored, and transmitted over a network. In <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_databases">“Databases and Streams”</a> we will investigate
        <span class="keep-together">the relationship</span> between streams and databases. And
        finally, in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_processing">“Processing Streams”</a> we will explore approaches and tools for processing those
        streams <span class="keep-together">continually</span>, and ways that they can be used to
        build applications.</p>

        <h1>Transmitting Event Streams</h1>
        
        <p>In the batch processing world, the inputs and outputs of a job are files (perhaps on a distributed
        filesystem). What does the streaming equivalent look like?</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" id="idm45085101142384"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="records" data-secondary="events in stream processing" id="idm45085101141552"></a>
        When the input is a file (a sequence of bytes), the first processing step is usually to parse it
        into a sequence of records. In a stream processing context, a record is more commonly known as an
        <em>event</em>, but it is essentially the same thing: a small, self-contained, immutable object containing
        the details of something that happened at some point in time. An event usually contains a timestamp
        indicating when it happened according to a time-of-day clock (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_monotonic_timeofday">“Monotonic Versus Time-of-Day Clocks”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>For example, the thing that happened might be an action that a user took, such as viewing a page or
        making a purchase. It might also originate from a machine, such as a periodic measurement from a
        temperature sensor, or a CPU utilization metric. In the example of <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_unix">“Batch Processing with Unix Tools”</a>, each line of
        the web server log is an event.</p>
        
        <p>An event may be encoded as a text string, or JSON, or perhaps in some binary form, as discussed in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch_encoding">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>. This encoding allows you to store an event, for example by appending it to a file,
        inserting it into a relational table, or writing it to a document database. It also allows you to
        send the event over the network to another node in order to process it.</p>

        In batch processing, a file is written once and then potentially read by multiple jobs. Analogously,
        in streaming terminology, an event is generated once by a <em>producer</em> (also known as a <em>publisher</em> or
        <em>sender</em>), and then potentially processed by multiple <em>consumers</em> (<em>subscribers</em> or <em>recipients</em>)
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Eugster2003ih_ch11-marker" href="ch11.html#Eugster2003ih_ch11">3</a>].
        In a filesystem, a filename identifies a set of related records; in a streaming system, related
        events are usually grouped together into a <em>topic</em> or <em>stream</em>.</p>
        
        <p>In principle, a file or database is sufficient to connect producers and consumers: a producer writes
        every event that it generates to the datastore, and each consumer periodically polls the datastore
        to check for events that have appeared since it last ran. This is essentially what a batch process
        does when it processes a day’s worth of data at the end of every day.</p>
        
        <p>However, when moving toward continual processing with low delays, polling becomes expensive if the
        datastore is not designed for this kind of usage. The more often you poll, the lower the percentage
        of requests that return new events, and thus the higher the overheads become. Instead, it is better
        for consumers to be notified when new events appear.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="triggers (databases)" id="idm45085101120912"></a>
        Databases have traditionally not supported this kind of notification mechanism very well: relational
        databases commonly have <em>triggers</em>, which can react to a change (e.g., a row being inserted into a
        table), but they are very limited in what they can do and have been somewhat of an afterthought in
        database design

        delivering event notifications.</p>

        <h2>Messaging Systems</h2>
        
        <p>A common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a <em>messaging system</em>: a
        producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to consumers. We touched on
        these systems previously in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_msg">“Message-Passing Dataflow”</a>, but we will now go into more detail.</p>
        
        <p>A direct communication channel like a Unix pipe or TCP connection between producer and consumer
        would be a simple way of implementing a messaging system. However, most messaging systems expand on
        this basic model. In particular, Unix pipes and TCP connect exactly one sender with one recipient,
        whereas a messaging system allows multiple producer nodes to send messages to the same topic and
        allows multiple consumer nodes to receive messages in a topic.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="publish/subscribe model" id="idm45085101109920"></a>
        Within this <em>publish/subscribe</em> model, different systems take a wide range of approaches, and there
        is no one right answer for all purposes. To differentiate the systems, it is particularly helpful to
        ask the following two questions:</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="backpressure" id="idm45085101107520"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="flow control" id="idm45085101106592"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consumers (message streams)" data-secondary="not keeping up with producers" id="idm45085101103472"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)" data-secondary="flow control" id="idm45085101102336"></a>
        <em>What happens if the producers send messages faster than the consumers can process them?</em>
        Broadly speaking, there are three options: the system can drop messages, buffer messages in a queue,
        or apply <em>backpressure</em> (also known as <em>flow control</em>; i.e., blocking the producer from sending more
        messages). For example, Unix pipes and TCP use backpressure: they have a small fixed-size buffer,
        and if it fills up, the sender is blocked until the recipient takes data out of the buffer (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_congestion">“Network congestion and queueing”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>If messages are buffered in a queue, it is important to understand what happens as that queue grows.
        Does the system crash if the queue no longer fits in memory, or does it write messages to disk? In
        the latter case, how does the disk access affect the performance of the messaging system
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Sackman2016ws-marker" href="ch11.html#Sackman2016ws">6</a>]?</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="reliability" data-secondary="of messaging systems" id="idm45085101092720"></a>
        <em>What happens if nodes crash or temporarily go offline—are any messages lost?</em> As with databases,
        durability may require some combination of writing to disk and/or replication (see the sidebar
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sidebar_transactions_durability">“Replication and Durability”</a>), which has a cost. If you can afford to sometimes lose
        messages, you can probably get higher throughput and lower latency on the same hardware.</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>Whether message loss is acceptable depends very much on the application. For example, with sensor
        readings and metrics that are transmitted periodically, an occasional missing data point is perhaps
        not important, since an updated value will be sent a short time later anyway. However, beware that
        if a large number of messages are dropped, it may not be immediately apparent that the metrics are
        incorrect [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Marti2015ww-marker" href="ch11.html#Marti2015ww">7</a>]. If you are counting
        events, it is more important that they are delivered reliably, since every lost message means
        incorrect counters.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="batch processing" data-secondary="fault tolerance" id="idm45085101086528"></a>
        A nice property of the batch processing systems we explored in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> is that they provide a
        strong reliability guarantee: failed tasks are automatically retried, and partial output from failed
        tasks is automatically discarded. This means the output is the same as if no failures had occurred,
        which helps simplify the programming model. Later in this chapter we will examine how we can provide
        similar guarantees in a streaming context.</p>

        A number of messaging systems use direct network communication between producers and consumers

        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Marti2015ww">7</a>] use unreliable UDP messaging for

        HTTP or RPC request (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_rpc">“Dataflow Through Services: REST and RPC”</a>) to push messages to the consumer. This is
        the idea behind webhooks [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Lindsay2007tl-marker" href="ch11.html#Lindsay2007tl">12</a>], a pattern in which a
        callback URL of one service is registered with another service, and it makes a request to that URL
        whenever an event occurs.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <p>Although these direct messaging systems work well in the situations for which they are designed,
        they generally require the application code to be aware of the possibility of message loss. The
        faults they can tolerate are quite limited: even if the protocols detect and retransmit packets that
        are lost in the network, they generally assume that producers and consumers are constantly online.</p>
        
        <p>If a consumer is offline, it may miss messages that were sent while it is unreachable. Some
        protocols allow the producer to retry failed message deliveries, but this approach may break down if
        the producer crashes, losing the buffer of messages that it was supposed to retry.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="message brokers" data-see="messaging systems" id="idm45085101051344"></a>
        A widely used alternative is to send messages via a <em>message broker</em> (also known as a <em>message
        queue</em>), which is essentially a kind of database that is optimized for handling message streams
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Gray1995tn-marker" href="ch11.html#Gray1995tn">13</a>]. It runs as a server,
        with producers and consumers connecting to it as clients. Producers write messages to the broker,
        and consumers receive them by reading them from the broker.</p>
        
        <p>By centralizing the data in the broker, these systems can more easily tolerate clients that come and
        go (connect, disconnect, and crash), and the question of durability is moved to the broker instead.
        Some message brokers only keep messages in memory, while others (depending on configuration) write
        them to disk so that they are not lost in case of a broker crash. Faced with slow consumers, they
        generally allow unbounded queueing (as opposed to dropping messages or backpressure), although this choice
        may also depend on the configuration.</p>
        
        <p>A consequence of queueing is also that consumers are generally <em>asynchronous</em>: when a producer sends
        a message, it normally only waits for the broker to confirm that it has buffered the message and
        does not wait for the message to be processed by consumers. The delivery to consumers will happen at
        some undetermined future point in time—often within a fraction of a second, but sometimes
        significantly later if there is a queue backlog.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="databases" data-secondary="comparison of message brokers to" id="idm45085101043600"></a>
        Some message brokers can even participate in two-phase commit protocols using XA or JTA (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans">“Distributed Transactions in Practice”</a>). This feature makes them quite similar in nature to databases, although
        there are still important practical differences between message brokers and databases:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Databases usually keep data until it is explicitly deleted, whereas most message brokers
        automatically delete a message when it has been successfully delivered to its consumers. Such
        message brokers are not suitable for long-term data storage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Since they quickly delete messages, most message brokers assume that their working set is fairly
        small—i.e., the queues are short. If the broker needs to buffer a lot of messages because the
        consumers are slow (perhaps spilling messages to disk if they no longer fit in memory), each
        individual message takes longer to process, and the overall throughput may degrade
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Sackman2016ws">6</a>].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Databases often support secondary indexes and various ways of searching for data, while message
        brokers often support some way of subscribing to a subset of topics matching some pattern. The
        mechanisms are different, but both are essentially ways for a client to select the portion of the
        data that it wants to know about.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>When querying a database, the result is typically based on a point-in-time snapshot of the data;
        if another client subsequently writes something to the database that changes the query result, the
        first client does not find out that its prior result is now outdated (unless it repeats the query,
        or polls for changes). By contrast, message brokers do not support arbitrary queries, but they do
        notify clients when data changes (i.e., when new messages become available).</p>

        <h3>Multiple consumers</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="messaging systems" data-secondary="message brokers" data-tertiary="multiple consumers of same topic" id="idm45085101014608"></a>
        When multiple consumers read messages in the same topic, two main patterns of messaging are
        used, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_multi_consumer">Figure&nbsp;11-1</a>:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>Load balancing</dt>
        <dd>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consumers (message streams)" data-secondary="load balancing" id="idm45085101011072"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="load balancing (messaging)" id="idm45085101009952"></a>
        Each message is delivered to <em>one</em> of the consumers, so the consumers can share the work of
        processing the messages in the topic. The broker may assign messages to consumers arbitrarily.
        This pattern is useful when the messages are expensive to process, and so you want to be able to
        add consumers to parallelize the processing. (In AMQP, you can implement load balancing by having
        multiple clients consuming from the same queue, and in JMS it is called a <em>shared</em> <span class="keep-together"><em>subscription</em></span>.)</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Fan-out</dt>
        <dd>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fan-out (messaging systems)" id="idm45085101004448"></a>
        Each message is delivered to <em>all</em> of the consumers. Fan-out allows several independent consumers
        to each “tune in” to the same broadcast of messages, without affecting each other—the streaming
        equivalent of having several different batch jobs that read the same input file. (This feature is
        provided by topic subscriptions in JMS, and exchange bindings in AMQP.)</p>

        <p>The two patterns can be combined: for example, two separate groups of consumers may each subscribe
        to a topic, such that each group collectively receives all messages, but within each group only one
        of the nodes receives each message.</p>

        Consumers may crash at any time, so it could happen that a broker delivers a message to a consumer
        but the consumer never processes it, or only partially processes it before crashing. In order to
        ensure that the message is not lost, message brokers use <em>acknowledgments</em>: a client must
        explicitly tell the broker when it has finished processing a message so that the broker can remove
        it from the queue.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="redelivery (messaging)" id="idm45085100993568"></a>
        If the connection to a client is closed or times out without the broker receiving an acknowledgment,
        it assumes that the message was not processed, and therefore it delivers the message again to
        another consumer. (Note that it could happen that the message actually <em>was</em> fully processed, but
        the acknowledgment was lost in the network. Handling this case requires an atomic commit protocol,
        as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans">“Distributed Transactions in Practice”</a>.)</p>
        
        <p>When combined with load balancing, this redelivery behavior has an interesting effect on the
        ordering of messages. In <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_redelivery">Figure&nbsp;11-2</a>, the consumers generally process messages in the
        order they were sent by producers. However, consumer 2 crashes while processing message <em>m3</em>, at the
        same time as consumer 1 is processing message <em>m4</em>. The unacknowledged message <em>m3</em> is subsequently
        redelivered to consumer 1, with the result that consumer 1 processes messages in the order <em>m4</em>, <em>m3</em>,
        <em>m5</em>. Thus, <em>m3</em> and <em>m4</em> are not delivered in the same order as they were sent by producer 1.</p>

        Even if the message broker otherwise tries to preserve the order of messages (as required by both
        the JMS and AMQP standards), the combination of load balancing with redelivery inevitably leads to
        messages being reordered. To avoid this issue, you can use a separate queue per consumer (i.e., not
        use the load balancing feature). Message reordering is not a problem if messages are completely
        independent of each other, but it can be important if there are causal dependencies between
        messages, as we shall see later in the chapter.

        Sending a packet over a network or making a request to a network service is normally a transient
        operation that leaves no permanent trace. Although it is possible to record it permanently (using
        packet capture and logging), we normally don’t think of it that way. Even message brokers that
        durably write messages to disk quickly delete them again after they have been delivered to
        consumers, because they are built around a transient messaging mindset.</p>
        
        <p>Databases and filesystems take the opposite approach: everything that is written to a database or
        file is normally expected to be permanently recorded, at least until someone explicitly chooses to
        delete it again.</p>
        
        <p>This difference in mindset has a big impact on how derived data is created. A key feature of batch
        processes, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>, is that you can run them repeatedly, experimenting with the
        processing steps, without risk of damaging the input (since the input is read-only). This is not the
        case with AMQP/JMS-style messaging: receiving a message is destructive if the acknowledgment causes
        it to be deleted from the broker, so you cannot run the same consumer again and expect to get the
        same result.</p>
        
        <p>If you add a new consumer to a messaging system, it typically only starts receiving messages sent
        after the time it was registered; any prior messages are already gone and cannot be recovered.
        Contrast this with files and databases, where you can add a new client at any time, and it can read
        data written arbitrarily far in the past (as long as it has not been explicitly overwritten or
        deleted by the application).</p>
        
        <p>Why can we not have a hybrid, combining the durable storage approach of databases with the
        low-latency notification facilities of messaging? This is the idea behind <em>log-based message
        brokers</em>.</p>

        A log is simply an append-only sequence of records on disk. We previously discussed logs in the
        context of log-structured storage engines and write-ahead logs in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch_storage">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, and in the context
        of replication in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch_replication">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tail (Unix tool)" id="idm45085100965216"></a>
        The same structure can be used to implement a message broker: a producer sends a message by
        appending it to the end of the log, and a consumer receives messages by reading the log
        sequentially. If a consumer reaches the end of the log, it waits for a notification that a new
        message has been appended. The Unix tool <code>tail -f</code>, which watches a file for data being appended,
        essentially works like this.</p>
        
        <p>In order to scale to higher throughput than a single disk can offer, the log can be <em>partitioned</em>
        (in the sense of <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch_partitioning">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>). Different partitions can then be hosted on different
        machines, making each partition a separate log that can be read and written independently from other
        partitions. A topic can then be defined as a group of partitions that all carry messages of the same
        type. This approach is illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_kafka_partitions">Figure&nbsp;11-3</a>.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="offsets" data-secondary="messages in partitioned logs" id="idm45085100960496"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kafka (messaging)" data-secondary="message offsets" id="idm45085100959376"></a>
        Within each partition, the broker assigns a monotonically increasing sequence number, or <em>offset</em>,
        to every message (in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_kafka_partitions">Figure&nbsp;11-3</a>, the numbers in boxes are message offsets).
        Such a sequence number makes sense because a partition is append-only, so the messages within a
        partition are totally ordered. There is no ordering guarantee across different partitions.</p>

        The log-based approach trivially supports fan-out messaging, because several consumers can
        independently read the log without affecting each other—reading a message does not delete it from
        the log. To achieve load balancing across a group of consumers, instead of assigning individual
        messages to consumer clients, the broker can assign entire partitions to nodes in the consumer
        group.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consumers (message streams)" data-secondary="load balancing" id="idm45085100922928"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single-threaded execution" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085100921856"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="single-threaded execution" id="idm45085100920736"></a>
        Each client then consumes <em>all</em> the messages in the partitions it has been assigned. Typically, when
        a consumer has been assigned a log partition, it reads the messages in the partition sequentially,
        in a straightforward single-threaded manner. This coarse-grained load balancing approach has some
        downsides:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>The number of nodes sharing the work of consuming a topic can be at most the number of log
        partitions in that topic, because messages within the same partition are delivered to the same
        node.<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085100917584-marker" href="ch11.html#idm45085100917584">i</a></sup></p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>If a single message is slow to process, it holds up the processing of subsequent messages in that
        partition (a form of head-of-line blocking; see <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#sec_introduction_percentiles">“Describing Performance”</a>).</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Thus, in situations where messages may be expensive to process and you want to parallelize
        processing on a message-by-message basis, and where message ordering is not so important, the
        JMS/AMQP style of message broker is preferable. On the other hand, in situations with high message
        throughput, where each message is fast to process and where message ordering is important, the
        log-based approach works very well.</p>
        
        <p>Since partitioned logs typically preserve message ordering only within a single partition, all
        messages that need to be ordered consistently need to be routed to the same partition. For example,
        an application may require that the events relating to one particular user appear in a fixed order.
        This can be achieved by choosing the partition for an event based on the user ID of that event (in
        other words, making the user ID the <em>partitioning key</em>).</p>

        Consuming a partition sequentially makes it easy to tell which messages have been processed: all
        messages with an offset less than a consumer’s current offset have already been processed, and all
        messages with a greater offset have not yet been seen. Thus, the broker does not need to track
        acknowledgments for every single message—it only needs to periodically record the consumer
        offsets. The reduced bookkeeping overhead and the opportunities for batching and pipelining in this
        approach help increase the throughput of log-based systems.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="log sequence number" id="idm45085100904224"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="leader-based replication" data-secondary="log sequence number" id="idm45085100903392"></a>
        This offset is in fact very similar to the <em>log sequence number</em> that is commonly found in
        single-leader database replication, and which we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_new_replica">“Setting Up New Followers”</a>. In
        database replication, the log sequence number allows a follower to reconnect to a leader after it
        has become disconnected, and resume replication without skipping any writes. Exactly the same
        principle is used here: the message broker behaves like a leader database, and the consumer like a
        follower.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consumers (message streams)" data-secondary="failures" id="idm45085100900352"></a>
        If a consumer node fails, another node in the consumer group is assigned the failed consumer’s
        partitions, and it starts consuming messages at the last recorded offset. If the consumer had
        processed subsequent messages but not yet recorded their offset, those messages will be processed a
        second time upon restart. We will discuss ways of dealing with this issue later in the chapter.</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Disk space usage"><div class="sect3" id="sec_stream_disk_usage">
        <h3>Disk space usage</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consumers (message streams)" data-secondary="not keeping up with producers" id="idm45085100897056"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logs (data structure)" data-secondary="log-based messaging" data-tertiary="disk space usage" id="idm45085100896016"></a>
        If you only ever append to the log, you will eventually run out of disk space. To reclaim disk
        space, the log is actually divided into segments, and from time to time old segments are deleted or
        moved to archive storage. (We’ll discuss a more sophisticated way of freeing disk space later.)</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="circular buffers" id="idm45085100894080"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ring buffers" id="idm45085100893376"></a>
        This means that if a slow consumer cannot keep up with the rate of messages, and it falls so far
        behind that its consumer offset points to a deleted segment, it will miss some of the messages.
        Effectively, the log implements a bounded-size buffer that discards old messages when it gets full,
        also known as a <em>circular buffer</em> or <em>ring buffer</em>. However, since that buffer is on disk, it can be
        quite large.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hard disks" data-secondary="sequential write throughput" id="idm45085100891056"></a>
        Let’s do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. At the time of writing, a typical large hard drive has
        a capacity of 6&nbsp;TB and a sequential write throughput of 150&nbsp;MB/s. If you are writing
        messages at the fastest possible rate, it takes about 11 hours to fill the drive. Thus, the disk can
        buffer 11 hours’ worth of messages, after which it will start overwriting old messages. This ratio
        remains the same, even if you use many hard drives and machines. In practice, deployments rarely use
        the full write bandwidth of the disk, so the log can typically keep a buffer of several days’ or even
        weeks’ worth of messages.</p>
        
        <p>Regardless of how long you retain messages, the throughput of a log remains more or less constant,
        since every message is written to disk anyway [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Kreps2011wl">18</a>].
        This behavior is in contrast to messaging systems that keep messages in memory by default and only
        write them to disk if the queue grows too large: such systems are fast when queues are short and
        become much slower when they start writing to disk, so the throughput depends on the amount of
        history retained.</p>

        <h3>When consumers cannot keep up with producers</h3>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="messaging systems" data-secondary="event logs" data-tertiary="slow consumers" id="idm45085100884752"></a>
        At the beginning of <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_messaging">“Messaging Systems”</a> we discussed three choices of what to do if a consumer
        cannot keep up with the rate at which producers are sending messages: dropping messages, buffering,
        or applying backpressure. In this taxonomy, the log-based approach is a form of buffering with a
        large but fixed-size buffer (limited by the available disk space).</p>
        
        <p>If a consumer falls so far behind that the messages it requires are older than what is retained on
        disk, it will not be able to read those messages—so the broker effectively drops old messages that
        go back further than the size of the buffer can accommodate. You can monitor how far a consumer is
        behind the head of the log, and raise an alert if it falls behind significantly. As the buffer is
        large, there is enough time for a human operator to fix the slow consumer and allow it to catch up
        before it starts missing messages.</p>
        
        <p>Even if a consumer does fall too far behind and starts missing messages, only that consumer is
        affected; it does not disrupt the service for other consumers. This fact is a big operational
        advantage: you can experimentally consume a production log for development, testing, or debugging
        purposes, without having to worry much about disrupting production services. When a consumer is shut
        down or crashes, it stops consuming resources—the only thing that remains is its consumer offset.</p>
        
        <p>This behavior also contrasts with traditional message brokers, where you need to be careful to delete
        any queues whose consumers have been shut down—otherwise they continue unnecessarily accumulating
        messages and taking away memory from consumers that are still active.</p>

        We noted previously that with AMQP- and JMS-style message brokers, processing and acknowledging
        messages is a destructive operation, since it causes the messages to be deleted on the broker. On
        the other hand, in a log-based message broker, consuming messages is more like reading from a file:
        it is a read-only operation that does not change the log.</p>
        
        <p>The only side effect of processing, besides any output of the consumer, is that the consumer offset
        moves forward. But the offset is under the consumer’s control, so it can easily be manipulated if
        necessary: for example, you can start a copy of a consumer with yesterday’s offsets and write the
        output to a different location, in order to reprocess the last day’s worth of messages. You can
        repeat this any number of times, varying the processing code.</p>

        We have drawn some comparisons between message brokers and databases. Even though they have
        traditionally been considered separate categories of tools, we saw that log-based message
        brokers have been successful in taking ideas from databases and applying them to messaging. We can
        also go in reverse: take ideas from messaging and streams, and apply them to databases.</p>
        
        <p>We said previously that an event is a record of something that happened at some point in time. The
        thing that happened may be a user action (e.g., typing a search query), or a sensor reading, but it
        may also be a <em>write to a database</em>. The fact that something was written to a database is an event
        that can be captured, stored, and processed. This observation suggests that the connection between
        databases and streams runs deeper than just the physical storage of logs on disk—it is quite
        fundamental.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="derived data" data-secondary="maintaining derived state through logs" id="ix_derivedstatelogs"></a>
        In fact, a replication log (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_implementation">“Implementation of Replication Logs”</a>) is a stream of database write
        events, produced by the leader as it processes transactions. The followers apply that stream of
        writes to their own copy of the database and thus end up with an accurate copy of the same data.
        The events in the replication log describe the data changes that occurred.</p>

        We also came across the <em>state machine replication</em> principle in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_total_order">“Total Order Broadcast”</a>,
        which states: if every event represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the
        same events in the same order, then the replicas will all end up in the same final state.
        (Processing an event is assumed to be a deterministic operation.) It’s just another case of event
        streams!</p>
        
        <p>In this section we will first look at a problem that arises in heterogeneous data systems, and then
        explore how we can solve it by bringing ideas from event streams to databases.</p>

        As we have seen throughout this book, there is no single system that can satisfy all data storage,
        querying, and processing needs. In practice, most nontrivial applications need to combine
        several different technologies in order to satisfy their requirements: for example, using an OLTP
        database to serve user requests, a cache to speed up common requests, a full-text index to handle
        search queries, and a data warehouse for analytics. Each of these has its own copy of the data,
        stored in its own representation that is optimized for its own purposes.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="updating when data changes" id="idm45085100832960"></a>

        As the same or related data appears in several different places, they need to be kept in sync with
        one another: if an item is updated in the database, it also needs to be updated in the cache, search
        indexes, and data warehouse. With data warehouses this synchronization is usually performed by ETL
        processes (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_dwh">“Data Warehousing”</a>), often by taking a full copy of a database, transforming it, and
        bulk-loading it into the data warehouse—in other words, a batch process. Similarly, we saw in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_output">“The Output of Batch Workflows”</a> how search indexes, recommendation systems, and other derived data systems
        might be created using batch processes.</p>

        If periodic full database dumps are too slow, an alternative that is sometimes used is <em>dual
        writes</em>, in which the application code explicitly writes to each of the systems when data changes:
        for example, first writing to the database, then updating the search index, then invalidating the
        cache entries (or even performing those writes concurrently).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consistency" data-secondary="across different databases" id="idm45085100823232"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="secondary indexes" data-secondary="problems with dual writes" id="idm45085100819616"></a>
        However, dual writes have some serious problems, one of which is a race condition illustrated in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_write_order">Figure&nbsp;11-4</a>. In this example, two clients concurrently want to update an item X:
        client 1 wants to set the value to A, and client 2 wants to set it to B. Both clients first write
        the new value to the database, then write it to the search index. Due to unlucky timing, the
        requests are interleaved: the database first sees the write from client 1 setting the value to A,
        then the write from client 2 setting the value to B, so the final value in the database is B. The
        search index first sees the write from client 2, then client 1, so the final value in the search
        index is A. The two systems are now permanently inconsistent with each other, even though no error
        occurred.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="concurrency" data-secondary="dual writes, problems with" id="idm45085100814560"></a>
        Unless you have some additional concurrency detection mechanism, such as the version vectors we
        discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_concurrent">“Detecting Concurrent Writes”</a>, you will not even notice that concurrent writes
        occurred—one value will simply silently overwrite another value.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="atomicity (transactions)" data-secondary="atomic commit" data-tertiary="maintaining derived data" id="idm45085100812112"></a>
        Another problem with dual writes is that one of the writes may fail while the other succeeds. This
        is a fault-tolerance problem rather than a concurrency problem, but it also has the effect of the
        two systems becoming inconsistent with each other. Ensuring that they either both succeed or both
        fail is a case of the atomic commit problem, which is expensive to solve (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc">“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”</a>).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="replication" data-secondary="with heterogeneous data systems" id="idm45085100809232"></a>
        If you only have one replicated database with a single leader, then that leader determines the order
        of writes, so the state machine replication approach works among replicas of the database. However,
        in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_write_order">Figure&nbsp;11-4</a> there isn’t a single leader: the database may have a leader and the
        search index may have a leader, but neither follows the other, and so conflicts can occur (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_multi_leader">“Multi-Leader Replication”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>The situation would be better if there really was only one leader—for example, the database—and if
        we could make the search index a follower of the database. But is this possible in practice?

        The problem with most databases’ replication logs is that they have long been considered to be an
        internal implementation detail of the database, not a public API. Clients are supposed to query the
        database through its data model and query language, not parse the replication logs and try to
        extract data from them.</p>
        
        <p>For decades, many databases simply did not have a documented way of getting the log of changes
        written to them. For this reason it was difficult to take all the changes made in a database and
        replicate them to a different storage technology such as a search index, cache, or data warehouse.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="change data capture" id="idm45085100792048"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="changelogs" data-secondary="change data capture" id="idm45085100791216"></a>
        More recently, there has been growing interest in <em>change data capture</em> (CDC), which is the process
        of observing all data changes written to a database and extracting them in a form in which they can
        be replicated to other systems. CDC is especially interesting if changes are made available as a
        stream, immediately as they are written.</p>
        
        <p>For example, you can capture the changes in a database and continually apply the same changes to a
        search index. If the log of changes is applied in the same order, you can expect the data in the
        search index to match the data in the database. The search index and any other derived data systems
        are just consumers of the change stream, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_change_capture">Figure&nbsp;11-5</a>.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="systems of record" data-secondary="change data capture" id="idm45085100782000"></a>
        We can call the log consumers <em>derived data systems</em>, as discussed in the introduction to
        <a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part_systems">Part&nbsp;III</a>: the data stored in the search index and the data warehouse is just another view
        onto the data in the system of record. Change data capture is a mechanism for ensuring that all
        changes made to the system of record are also reflected in the derived data systems so that the
        derived systems have an accurate copy of the data.</p>
        
        <p>Essentially, change data capture makes one database the leader (the one from which the changes are
        captured), and turns the others into followers. A log-based message broker is well suited for
        transporting the change events from the source database to the derived systems, since it preserves
        the ordering of messages (avoiding the reordering issue of <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_redelivery">Figure&nbsp;11-2</a>).</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="database triggers" data-see="triggers" id="idm45085100775136"></a>
        Database triggers can be used to implement change data capture (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_trigger">“Trigger-based replication”</a>) by
        registering triggers that observe all changes to data tables and add corresponding entries to a
        changelog table.  However, they tend to be fragile and have significant performance overheads.
        Parsing the replication log can be a more robust approach, although it also comes with challenges,
        such as handling schema changes.</p>

        <p>Like message brokers, change data capture is usually asynchronous: the system of record database
        does not wait for the change to be applied to consumers before committing it. This design has the
        operational advantage that adding a slow consumer does not affect the system of record too much, but it
        has the downside that all the issues of replication lag apply (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_lag">“Problems with Replication Lag”</a>).</p>

        If you have the log of all changes that were ever made to a database, you can reconstruct the entire
        state of the database by replaying the log. However, in many cases, keeping all changes forever
        would require too much disk space, and replaying it would take too long, so the log needs to be
        truncated.</p>
        
        <p>Building a new full-text index, for example, requires a full copy of the entire database—it is
        not sufficient to only apply a log of recent changes, since it would be missing items that were not
        recently updated. Thus, if you don’t have the entire log history, you need to start with a
        consistent snapshot, as previously discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_new_replica">“Setting Up New Followers”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The snapshot of the database must correspond to a known position or offset in the change log, so
        that you know at which point to start applying changes after the snapshot has been processed. Some
        CDC tools integrate this snapshot facility, while others leave it as a manual operation.</p>

        If you can only keep a limited amount of log history, you need to go through the snapshot process
        every time you want to add a new derived data system. However, <em>log compaction</em> provides a good
        alternative.</p>
        
        <p>We discussed log compaction previously in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_hash_index">“Hash Indexes”</a>, in the context of
        log-structured storage engines (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#fig_storage_compaction">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a> for an example). The principle is
        simple: the storage engine periodically looks for log records with the same key, throws away any
        duplicates, and keeps only the most recent update for each key. This compaction and merging process
        runs in the background.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tombstones" id="idm45085100715280"></a>
        In a log-structured storage engine, an update with a special null value (a <em>tombstone</em>) indicates
        that a key was deleted, and causes it to be removed during log compaction. But as long as a key is
        not overwritten or deleted, it stays in the log forever. The disk space required for such a
        compacted log depends only on the current contents of the database, not the number of writes that
        have ever occurred in the database. If the same key is frequently overwritten, previous values will
        eventually be garbage-collected, and only the latest value will be retained.</p>
        
        <p>The same idea works in the context of log-based message brokers and change data capture. If the CDC
        system is set up such that every change has a primary key, and every update for a key replaces the
        previous value for that key, then it’s sufficient to keep just the most recent write for a
        particular key.</p>
        
        <p>Now, whenever you want to rebuild a derived data system such as a search index, you can start a new
        consumer from offset 0 of the log-compacted topic, and sequentially scan over all messages in the
        log. The log is guaranteed to contain the most recent value for every key in the database (and maybe
        some older values)—in other words, you can use it to obtain a full copy of the database contents without
        having to take another snapshot of the CDC source database.</p>

        This log compaction feature is supported by Apache Kafka. As we shall see later in this chapter, it
        allows the message broker to be used for durable storage, not just for transient messaging.</p>

        Increasingly, databases are beginning to support change streams as a first-class interface, rather
        than the typical retrofitted and reverse-engineered CDC efforts. For example, RethinkDB allows
        queries to subscribe to notifications when the results of a query change
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Akhmechet2015tq-marker" href="ch11.html#Akhmechet2015tq">36</a>], Firebase

        synchronization based on a change feed that is also made available to applications, and Meteor uses
        the MongoDB oplog to subscribe to data changes and update the user interface
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="DeBergalis2013vd-marker" href="ch11.html#DeBergalis2013vd">39</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="VoltDB (database)" data-secondary="output streams" id="idm45085100688816"></a>
        VoltDB allows transactions to continuously export data from a database in the form of a stream
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="VoltDBCh15-marker" href="ch11.html#VoltDBCh15">40</a>].
        The database represents an output stream in the relational data model as a table into which
        transactions can insert tuples, but which cannot be queried. The stream then consists of the log of
        tuples that committed transactions have written to this special table, in the order they were
        committed. External consumers can asynchronously consume this log and use it to update derived data
        systems.</p>

        database systems with Kafka. Once the stream of change events is in Kafka, it can be used to update
        derived data systems such as search indexes, and also feed into stream processing systems as
        discussed later in this chapter.

        There are some parallels between the ideas we’ve discussed here and <em>event sourcing</em>, a technique
        that was developed in the domain-driven design (DDD) community
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Young2014wp-marker" href="ch11.html#Young2014wp">42</a>, <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Fowler2005vd-marker" href="ch11.html#Fowler2005vd">43</a>, <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Vernon2013ww-marker" href="ch11.html#Vernon2013ww">44</a>]. We will discuss event
        sourcing briefly, because it incorporates some useful and relevant ideas for streaming systems.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="change data capture" data-secondary="comparison to event sourcing" id="idm45085100658288"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="immutability" data-secondary="in event sourcing" id="idm45085100656144"></a>
        Similarly to change data capture, event sourcing involves storing all changes to the application
        state as a log of change events. The biggest difference is that event sourcing applies the idea at a
        different level of abstraction:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>In change data capture, the application uses the database in a mutable way, updating and deleting
        records at will. The log of changes is extracted from the database at a low level (e.g., by parsing
        the replication log), which ensures that the order of writes extracted from the database matches
        the order in which they were actually written, avoiding the race condition in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_write_order">Figure&nbsp;11-4</a>. The application writing to the database does not need to be aware that
        CDC is occurring.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>In event sourcing, the application logic is explicitly built on the basis of immutable events that
        are written to an event log. In this case, the event store is append-only, and updates or deletes
        are discouraged or prohibited. Events are designed to reflect things that happened at the
        application level, rather than low-level state changes.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Event sourcing is a powerful technique for data modeling: from an application point of view it is
        more meaningful to record the user’s actions as immutable events, rather than recording the effect
        of those actions on a mutable database. Event sourcing makes it easier to evolve applications over
        time, helps with debugging by making it easier to understand after the fact why something happened,
        and guards against application bugs (see <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_immutability_pros">“Advantages of immutable events”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>For example, storing the event “student cancelled their course enrollment” clearly expresses the
        intent of a single action in a neutral fashion, whereas the side effects “one entry was deleted from
        the enrollments table, and one cancellation reason was added to the student feedback table” embed a
        lot of assumptions about the way the data is later going to be used. If a new application feature is
        introduced—for example, “the place is offered to the next person on the waiting list”—the event
        sourcing approach allows that new side effect to easily be chained off the existing event.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="star schemas" data-secondary="similarity to event sourcing" id="idm45085100647136"></a>
        Event sourcing is similar to the chronicle data model
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Jagadish1995ee-marker" href="ch11.html#Jagadish1995ee">45</a>], and there
        are also similarities between an event log and the fact table that you find in a star schema (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_analytics_schemas">“Stars and Snowflakes: Schemas for Analytics”</a>).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Event Store (database)" id="idm45085100641872"></a>
        Specialized databases such as Event Store
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="EventStore2016-marker" href="ch11.html#EventStore2016">46</a>]
        have been developed to support applications using event sourcing, but in general the approach is
        independent of any particular tool. A conventional database or a log-based message broker can also
        be used to build applications in this style.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Deriving current state from the event log"><div class="sect3" id="sec_stream_state_from_log">
        <h3>Deriving current state from the event log</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="derived data" data-secondary="in event sourcing" id="ix_derivedeventsrc"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="event sourcing" data-secondary="deriving current state from event log" id="idm45085100635392"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="state" data-secondary="deriving current state from the event log" id="idm45085100634272"></a>
        An event log by itself is not very useful, because users generally expect to see the current state
        of a system, not the history of modifications. For example, on a shopping website, users expect to
        be able to see the current contents of their cart, not an append-only list of all the changes they
        have ever made to their cart.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deterministic operations" data-secondary="in state machine replication" id="idm45085100632480"></a>
        Thus, applications that use event sourcing need to take the log of events (representing the data
        <em>written</em> to the system) and transform it into application state that is suitable for showing to
        a user (the way in which data is <em>read</em> from the system
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kleppmann2016ug-marker" href="ch11.html#Kleppmann2016ug">47</a>]).
        This transformation can use arbitrary logic, but it should be deterministic so that you can run it
        again and derive the same application state from the event log.</p>
        
        <p>Like with change data capture, replaying the event log allows you to reconstruct the current state
        of the system. However, log compaction needs to be handled differently:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>A CDC event for the update of a record typically contains the entire new version of the record, so
        the current value for a primary key is entirely determined by the most recent event for that
        primary key, and log compaction can discard previous events for the same key.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>On the other hand, with event sourcing, events are modeled at a higher level: an event typically
        expresses the intent of a user action, not the mechanics of the state update that occurred as a
        result of the action. In this case, later events typically do not override prior events, and so
        you need the full history of events to reconstruct the final state. Log compaction is not possible
        in the same way.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Applications that use event sourcing typically have some mechanism for storing snapshots of the
        current state that is derived from the log of events, so they don’t need to repeatedly reprocess
        the full log. However, this is only a performance optimization to speed up reads and recovery from
        crashes; the intention is that the system is able to store all raw events forever and reprocess
        the full event log whenever required. We discuss this assumption in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_immutability_limitations">“Limitations of immutability”</a>.

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" data-secondary="difference to commands" id="idm45085100618064"></a>
        The event sourcing philosophy is careful to distinguish between <em>events</em> and <em>commands</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Mak2014ta-marker" href="ch11.html#Mak2014ta">48</a>]. When a request from a
        user first arrives, it is initially a command: at this point it may still fail, for example because
        some integrity condition is violated. The application must first validate that it can execute the
        command. If the validation is successful and the command is accepted, it becomes an event, which is
        durable and immutable.</p>
        
        <p>For example, if a user tries to register a particular username, or reserve a seat on an airplane or
        in a theater, then the application needs to check that the username or seat is not already taken.
        (We previously discussed this example in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_consensus_ft">“Fault-Tolerant Consensus”</a>.) When that check has
        succeeded, the application can generate an event to indicate that a particular username was
        registered by a particular user ID, or that a particular seat has been reserved for a particular
        customer.</p>
        
        <p>At the point when the event is generated, it becomes a <em>fact</em>. Even if the customer later decides to
        change or cancel the reservation, the fact remains true that they formerly held a reservation for a
        particular seat, and the change or cancellation is a separate event that is added later.</p>
        
        <p>A consumer of the event stream is not allowed to reject an event: by the time the consumer sees the
        event, it is already an immutable part of the log, and it may have already been seen by other
        consumers. Thus, any validation of a command needs to happen synchronously, before it becomes an
        event—for example, by using a serializable transaction that atomically validates the command and
        publishes the event.</p>
        
        <p>Alternatively, the user request to reserve a seat could be split into two events: first a tentative
        reservation, and then a separate confirmation event once the reservation has been validated (as
        discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_abcast_to_lin">“Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast”</a>). This split allows the validation to take place in
        an asynchronous process.

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="application state" data-see="state" id="idm45085100592864"></a>
        We normally think of databases as storing the current state of the application—this
        representation is optimized for reads, and it is usually the most convenient for serving queries.
        The nature of state is that it changes, so databases support updating and deleting data as
        well as inserting it. How does this fit with immutability?</p>
        
        <p>Whenever you have state that changes, that state is the result of the events that mutated it over
        time. For example, your list of currently available seats is the result of the reservations you have
        processed, the current account balance is the result of the credits and debits on the account, and
        the response time graph for your web server is an aggregation of the individual response times of
        all web requests that have occurred.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="changelogs" id="idm45085100590288"></a>
        No matter how the state changes, there was always a sequence of events that caused those changes.
        Even as things are done and undone, the fact remains true that those events occurred. The key idea
        is that mutable state and an append-only log of immutable events do not contradict each other: they
        are two sides of the same coin. The log of all changes, the <em>changelog</em>, represents the evolution of
        state over time.</p>

        If you are mathematically inclined, you might say that the application state is what you get when
        you integrate an event stream over time, and a change stream is what you get when you differentiate
        the state by time, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_integral">Figure&nbsp;11-6</a>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Hyde2016-marker" href="ch11.html#Hyde2016">49</a>, <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Gupta1999uz-marker" href="ch11.html#Gupta1999uz">50</a>,

        The analogy has limitations (for example, the second derivative of state does not seem to be
        meaningful), but it’s a useful starting point for thinking about data.</p>

        If you store the changelog durably, that simply has the effect of making the state reproducible. If
        you consider the log of events to be your system of record, and any mutable state as being derived
        from it, it becomes easier to reason about the flow of data through a system. As Pat Helland puts it
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Helland2015vx-marker" href="ch11.html#Helland2015vx">52</a>]:</p>

        Immutability in databases is an old idea. For example, accountants have been using immutability for
        centuries in financial bookkeeping. When a transaction occurs, it is recorded in an append-only
        <em>ledger</em>, which is essentially a log of events describing money, goods, or services that have changed
        hands. The accounts, such as profit and loss or the balance sheet, are derived from the transactions
        in the ledger by adding them up [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kleppmann2011vr-marker" href="ch11.html#Kleppmann2011vr">53</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compensating transactions" id="idm45085100556688"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="correctness" data-secondary="of immutable data" id="idm45085100555792"></a>
        If a mistake is made, accountants don’t erase or change the incorrect transaction in the
        ledger—instead, they add another transaction that compensates for the mistake, for example refunding
        an incorrect charge. The incorrect transaction still remains in the ledger forever, because it might
        be important for auditing reasons. If incorrect figures, derived from the incorrect ledger, have
        already been published, then the figures for the next accounting period include a correction. This
        process is entirely normal in accounting [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Helland2007vk-marker" href="ch11.html#Helland2007vk">54</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Although such auditability is particularly important in financial systems, it is also beneficial for
        many other systems that are not subject to such strict regulation. As discussed in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_philosophy">“Philosophy of batch process outputs”</a>, if you accidentally deploy buggy code that writes bad data to a database,
        recovery is much harder if the code is able to destructively overwrite data. With an append-only log
        of immutable events, it is much easier to diagnose what happened and recover from the problem.</p>
        
        <p>Immutable events also capture more information than just the current state. For example, on a
        shopping website, a customer may add an item to their cart and then remove it again. Although the
        second event cancels out the first event from the point of view of order fulfillment, it may be
        useful to know for analytics purposes that the customer was considering a particular item but then
        decided against it. Perhaps they will choose to buy it in the future, or perhaps they found a
        substitute. This information is recorded in an event log, but would be lost in a database that
        deletes items when they are removed from the cart

        Moreover, by separating mutable state from the immutable event log, you can derive several different
        read-oriented representations from the same log of events. This works just like having multiple
        consumers of a stream (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_change_capture">Figure&nbsp;11-5</a>): for example, the analytic database Druid
        ingests directly from Kafka using this approach [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Yang2015ui-marker" href="ch11.html#Yang2015ui">55</a>],
        Pistachio is a distributed key-value store that uses Kafka as a commit log

        and Kafka Connect sinks can export data from Kafka to various different databases and indexes
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Narkhede2016uo">41</a>]. It would make sense for many other
        storage and indexing systems, such as search servers, to similarly take their input from a
        distributed log (see <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_sync">“Keeping Systems in Sync”</a>).</p>

        Having an explicit translation step from an event log to a database makes it easier to evolve your
        application over time: if you want to introduce a new feature that presents your existing data in
        some new way, you can use the event log to build a separate read-optimized view for the new feature,
        and run it alongside the existing systems without having to modify them. Running old and new systems
        side by side is often easier than performing a complicated schema migration in an existing system.
        Once the old system is no longer needed, you can simply shut it down and reclaim its resources
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Kleppmann2016ug">47</a>,

        Storing data is normally quite straightforward if you don’t have to worry about how it is going to
        be queried and accessed; many of the complexities of schema design, indexing, and storage engines
        are the result of wanting to support certain query and access patterns (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch_storage">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>). For
        this reason, you gain a lot of flexibility by separating the form in which data is written from the
        form it is read, and by allowing several different read views. This idea is sometimes known as
        <em>command query responsibility segregation</em> (CQRS) [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Young2014wp">42</a>,

        The traditional approach to database and schema design is based on the fallacy that data must be
        written in the same form as it will be queried. Debates about normalization and denormalization (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#sec_datamodels_many_to_many">“Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships”</a>) become largely irrelevant if you can translate data from a
        write-optimized event log to read-optimized application state: it is entirely reasonable to
        denormalize data in the read-optimized views, as the translation process gives you a mechanism for
        keeping it consistent with the event log.</p>

        recently written tweets by the people a particular user is following (like a mailbox). This is
        another example of read-optimized state: home timelines are highly denormalized, since your tweets
        are duplicated in all of the timelines of the people following you. However, the fan-out service
        keeps this duplicated state in sync with new tweets and new following relationships, which keeps the
        duplication manageable.</p>

        The biggest downside of event sourcing and change data capture is that the consumers of the event
        log are usually asynchronous, so there is a possibility that a user may make a write to the log,
        then read from a log-derived view and find that their write has not yet been reflected in the read
        view. We discussed this problem and potential solutions previously in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_ryw">“Reading Your Own Writes”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>One solution would be to perform the updates of the read view synchronously with appending the event
        to the log. This requires a transaction to combine the writes into an atomic unit, so either you
        need to keep the event log and the read view in the same storage system, or you need a distributed
        transaction across the different systems. Alternatively, you could use the approach discussed in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_abcast_to_lin">“Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, deriving the current state from an event log also simplifies some aspects of
        concurrency control. Much of the need for multi-object transactions (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_multi_object">“Single-Object and Multi-Object Operations”</a>) stems from a single user action requiring data to be changed in
        several different places. With event sourcing, you can design an event such that it is a
        self-contained description of a user action. The user action then requires only a single write in
        one place—namely appending the event to the log—which is easy to make atomic.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="single-threaded execution" id="idm45085100501504"></a>
        If the event log and the application state are partitioned in the same way (for example, processing
        an event for a customer in partition 3 only requires updating partition 3 of the application state),
        then a straightforward single-threaded log consumer needs no concurrency control for writes—by
        construction, it only processes a single event at a time (see also <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_serial">“Actual Serial Execution”</a>). The
        log removes the nondeterminism of concurrency by defining a serial order of events in a partition
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Kreps2013vs_ch11">24</a>]. If an event touches multiple state
        partitions, a bit more work is required, which we will discuss in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#ch_future">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>.

        Many systems that don’t use an event-sourced model nevertheless rely on immutability: various
        databases internally use immutable data structures or multi-version data to support point-in-time
        snapshots (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_snapshot_indexes">“Indexes and snapshot isolation”</a>). Version control systems such as Git,
        Mercurial, and Fossil also rely on immutable data to preserve version history of files.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="garbage collection" data-secondary="immutability and" id="idm45085100488496"></a>
        To what extent is it feasible to keep an immutable history of all changes forever? The answer
        depends on the amount of churn in the dataset. Some workloads mostly add data and rarely update or
        delete; they are easy to make immutable. Other workloads have a high rate of updates and deletes on
        a comparatively small dataset; in these cases, the immutable history may grow prohibitively large,
        fragmentation may become an issue, and the performance of compaction and garbage collection becomes
        crucial for operational robustness [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Schwartz2013ur_ch11-marker" href="ch11.html#Schwartz2013ur_ch11">60</a>,

        Besides the performance reasons, there may also be circumstances in which you need data to be
        deleted for administrative or legal reasons, in spite of all immutability. For example, privacy
        regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require that a user’s
        personal information be deleted and erroneous information be removed on demand, or an accidental

        In these circumstances, it’s not sufficient to just append another event to the log to indicate that
        the prior data should be considered deleted—you actually want to rewrite history and pretend that
        the data was never written in the first place. For example, Datomic calls this feature <em>excision</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="DatomicExcision-marker" href="ch11.html#DatomicExcision">62</a>], and the Fossil
        version control system has a similar concept called <em>shunning</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="FossilShun-marker" href="ch11.html#FossilShun">63</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Truly deleting data is surprisingly hard [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kreps2015zt-marker" href="ch11.html#Kreps2015zt">64</a>], since copies can live in many places: for example, storage engines, filesystems, and
        SSDs often write to a new location rather than overwriting in place
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Helland2015vx">52</a>], and backups are often deliberately
        immutable to prevent accidental deletion or corruption. Deletion is more a matter of “making it
        harder to retrieve the data” than actually “making it impossible to retrieve the data.”
        Nevertheless, you sometimes have to try, as we shall see in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#sec_future_legislation">“Legislation and self-regulation”</a>.

        <h1>Processing Streams</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" id="ix_streamproc"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="streams" data-secondary="processing" data-see="stream processing" id="idm45085100455808"></a>
        So far in this chapter we have talked about where streams come from (user activity events, sensors,
        and writes to databases), and we have talked about how streams are transported (through direct
        messaging, via message brokers, and in event logs).</p>
        
        <p>What remains is to discuss what you can do with the stream once you have it—namely, you can
        process it. Broadly, there are three options:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>You can take the data in the events and write it to a database, cache, search index, or similar
        storage system, from where it can then be queried by other clients. As shown in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_change_capture">Figure&nbsp;11-5</a>, this is a good way of keeping a database in sync with changes
        happening in other parts of the system—especially if the stream consumer is the only client
        writing to the database. Writing to a storage system is the streaming equivalent of what we
        discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_output">“The Output of Batch Workflows”</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>You can push the events to users in some way, for example by sending email alerts or push
        notifications, or by streaming the events to a real-time dashboard where they are visualized.
        In this case, a human is the ultimate consumer of the stream.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>You can process one or more input streams to produce one or more output streams. Streams may go
        through a pipeline consisting of several such processing stages before they eventually end up at
        an output (option 1 or 2).</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="operators" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085100447744"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Unix philosophy" data-secondary="comparison to stream processing" id="idm45085100446640"></a>
        In the rest of this chapter, we will discuss option 3: processing streams to produce other, derived
        streams. A piece of code that processes streams like this is known as an <em>operator</em> or a <em>job</em>. It
        is closely related to the Unix processes and MapReduce jobs we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>, and
        the pattern of dataflow is similar: a stream processor consumes input streams in a read-only
        fashion and writes its output to a different location in an append-only fashion.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="comparison to batch processing" id="idm45085100443264"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="MapReduce (batch processing)" data-secondary="comparison to stream processing" id="idm45085100441024"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dataflow engines" data-secondary="comparison to stream processing" id="idm45085100439888"></a>
        The patterns for partitioning and parallelization in stream processors are also very similar to
        those in MapReduce and the dataflow engines we saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>, so we won’t repeat those topics
        here. Basic mapping operations such as transforming and filtering records also work the same.</p>
        
        <p>The one crucial difference to batch jobs is that a stream never ends. This difference has many
        implications: as discussed at the start of this chapter, sorting does not make sense with an
        unbounded dataset, and so sort-merge joins (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_reduce_joins">“Reduce-Side Joins and Grouping”</a>) cannot be used.
        Fault-tolerance mechanisms must also change: with a batch job that has been running for a few
        minutes, a failed task can simply be restarted from the beginning, but with a stream job that has
        been running for several years, restarting from the beginning after a crash may not be a viable option.</p>

        <h2>Uses of Stream Processing</h2>
        
        <p>Stream processing has long been used for monitoring purposes, where an organization wants to be
        alerted if certain things happen. For example:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Fraud detection systems need to determine if the usage patterns of a credit card have unexpectedly
        changed, and block the card if it is likely to have been stolen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Trading systems need to examine price changes in a financial market and execute trades according
        to specified rules.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Manufacturing systems need to monitor the status of machines in a factory, and quickly identify
        the problem if there is a malfunction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Military and intelligence systems need to track the activities of a potential aggressor, and raise
        the alarm if there are signs of an attack.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These kinds of applications require quite sophisticated pattern matching and correlations. However,
        other uses of stream processing have also emerged over time. In this section we will briefly compare
        and contrast some of these applications.</p>

        <h3>Complex event processing</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="complex event processing (CEP)" id="idm45085100426896"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="complex event processing (CEP)" id="idm45085100425552"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CEP" data-see="complex event processing" id="idm45085100424704"></a>
        <em>Complex event processing</em> (CEP) is an approach developed in the 1990s for analyzing event streams,
        especially geared toward the kind of application that requires searching for certain event patterns
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Luckham2006tv-marker" href="ch11.html#Luckham2006tv">65</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Perera2015tz-marker" href="ch11.html#Perera2015tz">66</a>].
        Similarly to the way that a regular expression allows you to search for certain patterns of
        characters in a string, CEP allows you to specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in
        a stream.</p>
        
        <p>CEP systems often use a high-level declarative query language like SQL, or a graphical user
        interface, to describe the patterns of events that should be detected. These queries are submitted to
        a processing engine that consumes the input streams and internally maintains a state machine that
        performs the required matching. When a match is found, the engine emits a <em>complex event</em> (hence the
        name) with the details of the event pattern that was detected
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Arasu2006df-marker" href="ch11.html#Arasu2006df">67</a>].</p>
        
        <p>In these systems, the relationship between queries and data is reversed compared to normal
        databases. Usually, a database stores data persistently and treats queries as transient: when a
        query comes in, the database searches for data matching the query, and then forgets about the query
        when it has finished.  CEP engines reverse these roles: queries are stored long-term, and events
        from the input streams continuously flow past them in search of a query that matches an event pattern

        Another area in which stream processing is used is for <em>analytics</em> on streams. The boundary between
        CEP and stream analytics is blurry, but as a general rule, analytics tends to be less interested in
        finding specific event sequences and is more oriented toward aggregations and statistical metrics
        over a large number of events—for example:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Measuring the rate of some type of event (how often it occurs per time interval)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Calculating the rolling average of a value over some time period</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Comparing current statistics to previous time intervals (e.g., to detect trends or to alert on
        metrics that are unusually high or low compared to the same time last week)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="windows (stream processing)" id="idm45085100386272"></a>
        Such statistics are usually computed over fixed time intervals—for example, you might want to
        know the average number of queries per second to a service over the last 5 minutes, and their
        99th percentile response time during that period. Averaging over a few minutes smoothes out
        irrelevant fluctuations from one second to the next, while still giving you a timely picture of any
        changes in traffic pattern. The time interval over which you aggregate is known as a <em>window</em>, and
        we will look into windowing in more detail in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_time">“Reasoning About Time”</a>.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HyperLogLog (algorithm)" id="idm45085100381568"></a>
        Stream analytics systems sometimes use probabilistic algorithms, such as Bloom filters (which we
        encountered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_lsm_optimize">“Performance optimizations”</a>) for set membership, HyperLogLog
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Flajolet2007um-marker" href="ch11.html#Flajolet2007um">72</a>] for cardinality estimation, and various
        percentile estimation algorithms (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#sidebar_percentiles">“Percentiles in Practice”</a>). Probabilistic algorithms produce
        approximate results, but have the advantage of requiring significantly less memory in the stream
        processor than exact algorithms. This use of approximation algorithms sometimes leads people to
        believe that stream processing systems are always lossy and inexact, but that is wrong: there is
        nothing inherently approximate about stream processing, and probabilistic algorithms are merely an
        optimization [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kreps2014wv_ch11-marker" href="ch11.html#Kreps2014wv_ch11">73</a>].</p>

        We saw in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_databases">“Databases and Streams”</a> that a stream of changes to a database can be used to keep
        derived data systems, such as caches, search indexes, and data warehouses, up to date with a source
        database. We can regard these examples as specific cases of maintaining <em>materialized views</em> (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_materialized_views">“Aggregation: Data Cubes and Materialized Views”</a>): deriving an alternative view onto some dataset so that you can
        query it efficiently, and updating that view whenever the underlying data changes

        Similarly, in event sourcing, application state is maintained by applying a log of events; here the
        application state is also a kind of materialized view. Unlike stream analytics scenarios, it is
        usually not sufficient to consider only events within some time window: building the materialized
        view potentially requires <em>all</em> events over an arbitrary time period, apart from any obsolete events

        window that stretches all the way back to the beginning of time.</p>

        In principle, any stream processor could be used for materialized view maintenance, although the
        need to maintain events forever runs counter to the assumptions of some analytics-oriented
        frameworks that mostly operate on windows of a limited duration. Samza and Kafka Streams support
        this kind of usage, building upon Kafka’s support for log compaction

        Besides CEP, which allows searching for patterns consisting of multiple events, there is also
        sometimes a need to search for individual events based on complex criteria, such as full-text search
        queries.</p>

        For example, media monitoring services subscribe to feeds of news articles and broadcasts from media
        outlets, and search for any news mentioning companies, products, or topics of interest. This is done
        by formulating a search query in advance, and then continually matching the stream of news items
        against this query. Similar features exist on some websites: for example, users of real estate
        websites can ask to be notified when a new property matching their search criteria appears on the
        market. The percolator feature of Elasticsearch
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Banon2011hw-marker" href="ch11.html#Banon2011hw">76</a>] is one option for implementing this kind of stream search.</p>
        
        <p>Conventional search engines first index the documents and then run queries over the index. By
        contrast, searching a stream turns the processing on its head: the queries are stored, and the
        documents run past the queries, like in CEP. In the simplest case, you can test every document
        against every query, although this can get slow if you have a large number of queries. To optimize
        the process, it is possible to index the queries as well as the documents, and thus narrow down the
        set of queries that may match

        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_msg">“Message-Passing Dataflow”</a> we discussed message-passing systems as an alternative to RPC—i.e.,
        as a mechanism for services to communicate, as used for example in the actor model. Although these
        systems are also based on messages and events, we normally don’t think of them as stream processors:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Actor frameworks are primarily a mechanism for managing concurrency and distributed execution of
        communicating modules, whereas stream processing is primarily a data management technique.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Communication between actors is often ephemeral and one-to-one, whereas event logs are durable and
        multi-subscriber.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Actors can communicate in arbitrary ways (including cyclic request/response patterns), but stream
        processors are usually set up in acyclic pipelines where every stream is the output of one
        particular job, and derived from a well-defined set of input streams.</p>

        That said, there is some crossover area between RPC-like systems and stream processing. For
        example, Apache Storm has a feature called <em>distributed RPC</em>, which allows user queries to be farmed
        out to a set of nodes that also process event streams; these queries are then interleaved with
        events from the input streams, and results can be aggregated and sent back to the user

        <p>It is also possible to process streams using actor frameworks. However, many such frameworks do not
        guarantee message delivery in the case of crashes, so the processing is not fault-tolerant unless
        you implement additional retry logic.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="windows (stream processing)" id="ix_windowstream"></a>
        Stream processors often need to deal with time, especially when used for analytics purposes, which
        frequently use time windows such as “the average over the last five minutes.” It might seem that the
        meaning of “the last five minutes” should be unambiguous and clear, but unfortunately the notion is
        surprisingly tricky.</p>
        
        <p>In a batch process, the processing tasks rapidly crunch through a large collection of historical
        events. If some kind of breakdown by time needs to happen, the batch process needs to look at the
        timestamp embedded in each event. There is no point in looking at the system clock of the machine
        running the batch process, because the time at which the process is run has nothing to do with the
        time at which the events actually occurred.</p>
        
        <p>A batch process may read a year’s worth of historical events within a few minutes; in most cases, the
        timeline of interest is the year of history, not the few minutes of processing. Moreover, using the
        timestamps in the events allows the processing to be deterministic: running the same process again on
        the same input yields the same result (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_materialize_ft">“Fault tolerance”</a>).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="processing time (of events)" id="idm45085100306272"></a>
        On the other hand, many stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing
        machine (the <em>processing time</em>) to determine windowing
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Akidau2016tb-marker" href="ch11.html#Akidau2016tb">79</a>].
        This approach has the advantage of being simple, and it is reasonable if the delay between event
        creation and event processing is negligibly short. However, it breaks down if there is any
        significant processing lag—i.e., if the processing may happen noticeably later than the time at
        which the event actually occurred.</p>

        There are many reasons why processing may be delayed: queueing, network faults (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_networks">“Unreliable Networks”</a>), a performance issue leading to contention in the message broker or
        processor, a restart of the stream consumer, or reprocessing of past events (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_replay">“Replaying old messages”</a>) while recovering from a fault or after fixing a bug in the code.</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, message delays can also lead to unpredictable ordering of messages. For example, say a user
        first makes one web request (which is handled by web server A), and then a second request (which is
        handled by server B). A and B emit events describing the requests they handled, but B’s event
        reaches the message broker before A’s event does. Now stream processors will first see the B event
        and then the A event, even though they actually occurred in the opposite order.</p>

        If it helps to have an analogy, consider the <em>Star Wars</em> movies: Episode IV was released in 1977,
        Episode V in 1980, and Episode VI in 1983, followed by Episodes I, II, and III in 1999, 2002, and 2005,
        respectively, and Episodes VII and VIII in 2015 and 2017
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Ewen2016tz-marker" href="ch11.html#Ewen2016tz">80</a>].<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085100290208-marker" href="ch11.html#idm45085100290208">ii</a></sup> If you watched the movies in the order
        they came out, the order in which you processed the movies is inconsistent with the order of their
        narrative. (The episode number is like the event timestamp, and the date when you watched the movie
        is the processing time.) As humans, we are able to cope with such discontinuities, but stream
        processing algorithms need to be specifically written to accommodate such timing and ordering
        issues.</p>
        
        <p>Confusing event time and processing time leads to bad data. For example, say you have a stream
        processor that measures the rate of requests (counting the number of requests per second). If you
        redeploy the stream processor, it may be shut down for a minute and process the backlog of events
        when it comes back up. If you measure the rate based on the processing time, it will look as if
        there was a sudden anomalous spike of requests while processing the backlog, when in fact the real
        rate of requests was steady (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig_stream_processing_time">Figure&nbsp;11-7</a>).</p>

        A tricky problem when defining windows in terms of event time is that you can never be sure when you
        have received all of the events for a particular window, or whether there are some events still to
        come.</p>
        
        <p>For example, say you’re grouping events into one-minute windows so that you can count the number of
        requests per minute. You have counted some number of events with timestamps that fall in the 37th
        minute of the hour, and time has moved on; now most of the incoming events fall within the
        38th and 39th minutes of the hour. When do you declare that you have finished the window for the 37th
        minute, and output its counter value?</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="straggler events" id="idm45085100278224"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" data-secondary="stragglers" id="idm45085100277520"></a>
        You can time out and declare a window ready after you have not seen any new events for that window
        in a while. However, it could still happen that some events were buffered on another machine
        somewhere, delayed due to a network interruption. You need to be able to handle such <em>straggler</em>
        events that arrive after the window has already been declared complete. Broadly, you have two
        options [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Akidau2015gh">1</a>]:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Ignore the straggler events, as they are probably a small percentage of events in normal
        circumstances. You can track the number of dropped events as a metric, and alert if you start
        dropping a significant amount of data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Publish a <em>correction</em>, an updated value for the window with stragglers included. You may also
        need to retract the previous output.</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>In some cases it is possible to use a special message to indicate, “From now on there will be no more
        messages with a timestamp earlier than <em>t</em>,” which can be used by consumers to trigger windows
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Akidau2013uz-marker" href="ch11.html#Akidau2013uz">81</a>]. However, if several producers on different machines are generating events,
        each with their own minimum timestamp thresholds, the consumers need to keep track of each producer
        individually. Adding and removing producers is trickier in this case.</p>

        Assigning timestamps to events is even more difficult when events can be buffered at several points
        in the system. For example, consider a mobile app that reports events for usage metrics to a server.
        The app may be used while the device is offline, in which case it will buffer events locally on the
        device and send them to a server when an internet connection is next available (which may be hours
        or even days later). To any consumers of this stream, the events will appear as extremely delayed
        stragglers.</p>
        
        <p>In this context, the timestamp on the events should really be the time at which the user interaction
        occurred, according to the mobile device’s local clock. However, the clock on a user-controlled
        device often cannot be trusted, as it may be accidentally or deliberately set to the wrong time (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_clock_accuracy">“Clock Synchronization and Accuracy”</a>). The time at which the event was received by the server
        (according to the server’s clock) is more likely to be accurate, since the server is under your
        control, but less meaningful in terms of describing the user interaction.</p>
        
        <p>To adjust for incorrect device clocks, one approach is to log three timestamps
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Dean2015tn-marker" href="ch11.html#Dean2015tn">82</a>]:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>The time at which the event occurred, according to the device clock</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The time at which the event was sent to the server, according to the device clock</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The time at which the event was received by the server, according to the server clock</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By subtracting the second timestamp from the third, you can estimate the offset between the device
        clock and the server clock (assuming the network delay is negligible compared to the required
        timestamp accuracy). You can then apply that offset to the event timestamp, and thus estimate the
        true time at which the event actually occurred (assuming the device clock offset did not change
        between the time the event occurred and the time it was sent to the server).</p>
        
        <p>This problem is not unique to stream processing—batch processing suffers from exactly the same
        issues of reasoning about time. It is just more noticeable in a streaming context, where we are more
        aware of the passage of time.</p>

        windows over time periods should be defined. The window can then be used for aggregations, for
        example to count events, or to calculate the average of values within the window. Several types of
        windows are in common use [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Akidau2016tb">79</a>,

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tumbling windows (stream processing)" data-seealso="windows" id="idm45085100241664"></a>
        A tumbling window has a fixed length, and every event belongs to exactly one window. For example,
        if you have a 1-minute tumbling window, all the events with timestamps between 10:03:00 and
        10:03:59 are grouped into one window, events between 10:04:00 and 10:04:59 into the next window,
        and so on. You could implement a 1-minute tumbling window by taking each event timestamp and
        rounding it down to the nearest minute to determine the window that it belongs to.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hopping windows (stream processing)" data-seealso="windows" id="idm45085100238912"></a>
        A hopping window also has a fixed length, but allows windows to overlap in order to provide some
        smoothing. For example, a 5-minute window with a hop size of 1 minute would contain the events
        between 10:03:00 and 10:07:59, then the next window would cover events between 10:04:00 and
        10:08:59, and so on. You can implement this hopping window by first calculating 1-minute tumbling
        windows, and then aggregating over several adjacent windows.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sliding windows (stream processing)" data-seealso="windows" id="idm45085100236176"></a>
        A sliding window contains all the events that occur within some interval of each other. For
        example, a 5-minute sliding window would cover events at 10:03:39 and 10:08:12, because they are
        less than 5 minutes apart (note that tumbling and hopping 5-minute windows would not have put
        these two events in the same window, as they use fixed boundaries). A sliding window can be
        implemented by keeping a buffer of events sorted by time and removing old events when they expire
        from the window.</p>

        Unlike the other window types, a session window has no fixed duration. Instead, it is defined by
        grouping together all events for the same user that occur closely together in time, and the window
        ends when the user has been inactive for some time (for example, if there have been no events for
        30 minutes). Sessionization is a common requirement for website analytics (see

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="joins" data-secondary="stream joins" id="ix_joinstream"></a>
        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> we discussed how batch jobs can join datasets by key, and how such joins form an
        important part of data pipelines. Since stream processing generalizes data pipelines to incremental
        processing of unbounded datasets, there is exactly the same need for joins on streams.</p>
        
        <p>However, the fact that new events can appear anytime on a stream makes joins on streams more
        challenging than in batch jobs. To understand the situation better, let’s distinguish three
        different types of joins: <em>stream-stream</em> joins, <em>stream-table</em> joins, and <em>table-table</em> joins
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="SamzaState-marker" href="ch11.html#SamzaState">84</a>].
        In the following sections we’ll illustrate each by example.</p>

        Say you have a search feature on your website, and you want to detect recent trends in searched-for
        URLs. Every time someone types a search query, you log an event containing the query and the results
        returned. Every time someone clicks one of the search results, you log another event
        recording the click. In order to calculate the click-through rate for each URL in the search
        results, you need to bring together the events for the search action and the click action, which are
        connected by having the same session ID. Similar analyses are needed in advertising systems
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Ananthanarayanan2013hw-marker" href="ch11.html#Ananthanarayanan2013hw">85</a>].</p>
        
        <p>The click may never come if the user abandons their search, and even if it comes, the time between
        the search and the click may be highly variable: in many cases it might be a few seconds, but it
        could be as long as days or weeks (if a user runs a search, forgets about that browser tab, and then
        returns to the tab and clicks a result sometime later). Due to variable network delays, the click
        event may even arrive before the search event. You can choose a suitable window for the join—for
        example, you may choose to join a click with a search if they occur at most one hour apart.</p>
        
        <p>Note that embedding the details of the search in the click event is not equivalent to joining the
        events: doing so would only tell you about the cases where the user clicked a search result, not
        about the searches where the user did not click any of the results. In order to measure search
        quality, you need accurate click-through rates, for which you need both the search events and the
        click events.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="state" data-secondary="maintenance by stream processor in stream-stream joins" id="idm45085100206496"></a>
        To implement this type of join, a stream processor needs to maintain <em>state</em>: for example, all the
        events that occurred in the last hour, indexed by session ID. Whenever a search event or click event
        occurs, it is added to the appropriate index, and the stream processor also checks the other index
        to see if another event for the same session ID has already arrived. If there is a matching event,
        you emit an event saying which search result was clicked. If the search event expires without you
        seeing a matching click event, you emit an event saying which search results were not clicked.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="enrichment (stream)" id="idm45085100199936"></a>
        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_join_example">“Example: analysis of user activity events”</a> (<a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#fig_batch_join_example">Figure&nbsp;10-2</a>) we saw an example of a batch job joining
        two datasets: a set of user activity events and a database of user profiles. It is natural to think
        of the user activity events as a stream, and to perform the same join on a continuous basis in a
        stream processor: the input is a stream of activity events containing a user ID, and the output is a
        stream of activity events in which the user ID has been augmented with profile information about the
        user. This process is sometimes known as <em>enriching</em> the activity events with information from the
        database.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="accessing external services within job" id="idm45085100196304"></a>
        To perform this join, the stream process needs to look at one activity event at a time, look up the
        event’s user ID in the database, and add the profile information to the activity event. The database
        lookup could be implemented by querying a remote database; however, as discussed in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_join_example">“Example: analysis of user activity events”</a>, such remote queries are likely to be slow and risk overloading the database
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Kreps2014wm_ch11">75</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="locality (data access)" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085100192912"></a>
        Another approach is to load a copy of the database into the stream processor so that it can be
        queried locally without a network round-trip. This technique is very similar to the hash joins we
        discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_map_joins">“Map-Side Joins”</a>: the local copy of the database might be an in-memory hash
        table if it is small enough, or an index on the local disk.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="changelogs" data-secondary="in stream joins" id="idm45085100190400"></a>
        The difference to batch jobs is that a batch job uses a point-in-time snapshot of the database as
        input, whereas a stream processor is long-running, and the contents of the database are likely to
        change over time, so the stream processor’s local copy of the database needs to be kept up to date.
        This issue can be solved by change data capture: the stream processor can subscribe to a changelog
        of the user profile database as well as the stream of activity events. When a profile is created or
        modified, the stream processor updates its local copy. Thus, we obtain a join between two streams:
        the activity events and the profile updates.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="windows (stream processing)" data-secondary="infinite windows for changelogs" id="idm45085100188384"></a>
        A stream-table join is actually very similar to a stream-stream join; the biggest difference is that
        for the table changelog stream, the join uses a window that reaches back to the “beginning of time”
        (a conceptually infinite window), with newer versions of records overwriting older ones. For the
        stream input, the join might not maintain a window at all.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Twitter" data-secondary="constructing home timelines (example)" id="idm45085100181808"></a>
        Consider the Twitter timeline example that we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#sec_introduction_scalability_load">“Describing Load”</a>. We
        said that when a user wants to view their home timeline, it is too expensive to iterate over all the
        people the user is following, find their recent tweets, and merge them.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, we want a timeline cache: a kind of per-user “inbox” to which tweets are written as they
        are sent, so that reading the timeline is a single lookup. Materializing and maintaining this cache
        requires the following event processing:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>When user <em>u</em> sends a new tweet, it is added to the timeline of every user who is following <em>u</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>When a user deletes a tweet, it is removed from all users’ timelines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>When user <em>u</em><sub>1</sub> starts following user <em>u</em><sub>2</sub>, recent tweets by <em>u</em><sub>2</sub> are added to
        <em>u</em><sub>1</sub>’s <span class="keep-together">timeline.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>When user <em>u</em><sub>1</sub> unfollows user <em>u</em><sub>2</sub>, tweets by <em>u</em><sub>2</sub> are removed from <em>u</em><sub>1</sub>’s
        timeline.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To implement this cache maintenance in a stream processor, you need streams of events for tweets
        (sending and deleting) and for follow relationships (following and unfollowing). The stream process
        needs to maintain a database containing the set of followers for each user so that it knows which
        timelines need to be updated when a new tweet arrives
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="SamzaNewsfeed-marker" href="ch11.html#SamzaNewsfeed">86</a>].</p>

        Another way of looking at this stream process is that it maintains a materialized view for a query
        that joins two tables (tweets and follows), something like the following:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="sql"><code class="k">SELECT</code> <code class="n">follows</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="n">follower_id</code> <code class="k">AS</code> <code class="n">timeline_id</code><code class="p">,</code>

        <p>The join of the streams corresponds directly to the join of the tables in that query. The timelines
        are effectively a cache of the result of this query, updated every time the underlying tables
        change.<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085100131584-marker" href="ch11.html#idm45085100131584">iii</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Time-dependence of joins</h3>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="time" data-secondary="time-dependence in stream joins" id="idm45085100085152"></a>
        The three types of joins described here (stream-stream, stream-table, and table-table) have a lot in
        common: they all require the stream processor to maintain some state (search and click events, user
        profiles, or follower list) based on one join input, and query that state on messages from the other
        join input.</p>
        
        <p>The order of the events that maintain the state is important (it matters whether you first follow
        and then unfollow, or the other way round). In a partitioned log, the ordering of events within a
        single partition is preserved, but there is typically no ordering guarantee across different streams
        or partitions.</p>
        
        <p>This raises a question: if events on different streams happen around a similar time, in which order
        are they processed? In the stream-table join example, if a user updates their profile, which
        activity events are joined with the old profile (processed before the profile update), and which are
        joined with the new profile (processed after the profile update)? Put another way: if state changes
        over time, and you join with some state, what point in time do you use for the join
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Jagadish1995ee">45</a>]?</p>
        
        <p>Such time dependence can occur in many places. For example, if you sell things, you need to apply
        the right tax rate to invoices, which depends on the country or state, the type of product, and the
        date of sale (since tax rates change from time to time). When joining sales to a table of tax rates,
        you probably want to join with the tax rate at the time of the sale, which may be different from the
        current tax rate if you are reprocessing historical data.</p>
        
        <p>If the ordering of events across streams is undetermined, the join becomes nondeterministic
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kirwin2014vm-marker" href="ch11.html#Kirwin2014vm">87</a>], which means you cannot
        rerun the same job on the same input and necessarily get the same result: the events on the input
        streams may be interleaved in a different way when you run the job again.</p>

        In data warehouses, this issue is known as a <em>slowly changing dimension</em> (SCD), and it is often
        addressed by using a unique identifier for a particular version of the joined record: for example,

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="fault tolerance" id="ix_strmprfault"></a>
        In the final section of this chapter, let’s consider how stream processors can tolerate faults. We
        saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> that batch processing frameworks can tolerate faults fairly easily: if a task in
        a MapReduce job fails, it can simply be started again on another machine, and the output of the
        failed task is discarded. This transparent retry is possible because input files are immutable, each
        task writes its output to a separate file on HDFS, and output is only made visible when a task
        completes successfully.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exactly-once semantics" id="idm45085100060336"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="effectively-once semantics" data-seealso="exactly-once semantics" id="idm45085100059280"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="messages" data-secondary="exactly-once semantics" id="idm45085100058208"></a>
        In particular, the batch approach to fault tolerance ensures that the output of the batch job is the
        same as if nothing had gone wrong, even if in fact some tasks did fail. It appears as though every
        input record was processed exactly once—no records are skipped, and none are processed twice.
        Although restarting tasks means that records may in fact be processed multiple times, the visible
        effect in the output is as if they had only been processed once. This principle is known as
        <em>exactly-once semantics</em>, although <em>effectively-once</em> would be a more descriptive term
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Klang2016mw-marker" href="ch11.html#Klang2016mw">90</a>].</p>
        
        <p>The same issue of fault tolerance arises in stream processing, but it is less straightforward to
        handle: waiting until a task is finished before making its output visible is not an option, because
        a stream is infinite and so you can never finish processing it.</p>

        One solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a miniature batch
        process. This approach is called <em>microbatching</em>, and it is used in Spark Streaming
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Zaharia2012wa-marker" href="ch11.html#Zaharia2012wa">91</a>]. The
        batch size is typically around one second, which is the result of a performance compromise: smaller
        batches incur greater scheduling and coordination overhead, while larger batches mean a longer delay
        before results of the stream processor become visible.</p>

        Microbatching also implicitly provides a tumbling window equal to the batch size (windowed by
        processing time, not event timestamps); any jobs that require larger windows need to explicitly
        carry over state from one microbatch to the next.</p>

        A variant approach, used in Apache Flink, is to periodically generate rolling checkpoints of state and
        write them to durable storage
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Tzoumas2015tt-marker" href="ch11.html#Tzoumas2015tt">92</a>,

        If a stream operator crashes, it can restart from its most recent checkpoint and discard any output
        generated between the last checkpoint and the crash. The checkpoints are triggered by barriers in
        the message stream, similar to the boundaries between microbatches, but without forcing a particular
        window size.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="accessing external services within job" id="idm45085100030256"></a>
        Within the confines of the stream processing framework, the microbatching and checkpointing
        approaches provide the same exactly-once semantics as batch processing. However, as soon as output
        leaves the stream processor (for example, by writing to a database, sending messages to an external
        message broker, or sending emails), the framework is no longer able to discard the output of a
        failed batch. In this case, restarting a failed task causes the external side effect to happen
        twice, and microbatching or checkpointing alone is not sufficient to prevent this problem.</p>

        In order to give the appearance of exactly-once processing in the presence of faults, we need to
        ensure that all outputs and side effects of processing an event take effect <em>if and only if</em> the
        processing is successful. Those effects include any messages sent to downstream operators or
        external messaging systems (including email or push notifications), any database writes, any changes
        to operator state, and any acknowledgment of input messages (including moving the consumer offset
        forward in a log-based message broker).</p>
        
        <p>Those things either all need to happen atomically, or none of them must happen, but they should not
        go out of sync with each other. If this approach sounds familiar, it is because we discussed it in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_exactly_once">“Exactly-once message processing”</a> in the context of distributed transactions and two-phase commit.</p>

        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch_consistency">Chapter&nbsp;9</a> we discussed the problems in the traditional implementations of distributed
        transactions, such as XA. However, in more restricted environments it is possible to implement such
        an atomic commit facility efficiently. This approach is used in Google Cloud Dataflow
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Akidau2013uz">81</a>,
        <a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Tzoumas2015tt">92</a>], VoltDB

        and Apache Kafka [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Junqueira2016vv-marker" href="ch11.html#Junqueira2016vv">95</a>,

        Unlike XA, these implementations do not attempt to provide transactions across heterogeneous
        technologies, but instead keep the transactions internal by managing both state changes and
        messaging within the stream processing framework. The overhead of the transaction protocol can be
        amortized by processing several input messages within a single transaction.</p>

        Our goal is to discard the partial output of any failed tasks so that they can be safely retried
        without taking effect twice. Distributed transactions are one way of achieving that goal, but
        another way is to rely on <em>idempotence</em> [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Helland2012id-marker" href="ch11.html#Helland2012id">97</a>].</p>
        
        <p>An idempotent operation is one that you can perform multiple times, and it has the same effect as if
        you performed it only once. For example, setting a key in a key-value store to some fixed value is
        idempotent (writing the value again simply overwrites the value with an identical value), whereas
        incrementing a counter is not idempotent (performing the increment again means the value is
        incremented twice).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kafka (messaging)" data-secondary="message offsets" id="idm45085099996048"></a>
        Even if an operation is not naturally idempotent, it can often be made idempotent with a bit of
        extra metadata. For example, when consuming messages from Kafka, every message has a persistent,
        monotonically increasing offset. When writing a value to an external database, you can include the
        offset of the message that triggered the last write with the value. Thus, you can tell whether an
        update has already been applied, and avoid performing the same update again.</p>

        The state handling in Storm’s Trident is based on a similar idea
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#StormDocs">78</a>]. Relying on idempotence implies several
        assumptions: restarting a failed task must replay the same messages in the same order (a log-based
        message broker does this), the processing must be deterministic, and no other node may concurrently
        update the same value [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kreps2014zt-marker" href="ch11.html#Kreps2014zt">98</a>, <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Elnozahy2002fp-marker" href="ch11.html#Elnozahy2002fp">99</a>].</p>

        When failing over from one processing node to another, fencing may be required (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_lock_fencing">“The leader and the lock”</a>) to prevent interference from a node that is thought to be dead but
        is actually alive. Despite all those caveats, idempotent operations can be an effective way of
        achieving exactly-once semantics with only a small overhead.</p>

        Any stream process that requires state—for example, any windowed aggregations (such as counters,
        averages, and histograms) and any tables and indexes used for joins—must ensure that this state
        can be recovered after a failure.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="locality (data access)" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085099975696"></a>
        One option is to keep the state in a remote datastore and replicate it, although having to query a
        remote database for each individual message can be slow, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_table_joins">“Stream-table join (stream enrichment)”</a>.
        An alternative is to keep state local to the stream processor, and replicate it periodically. Then,
        when the stream processor is recovering from a failure, the new task can read the replicated state
        and resume processing without data loss.</p>

        For example, Flink periodically captures snapshots of operator state and writes them to durable
        storage such as HDFS [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Tzoumas2015tt">92</a>,
        <a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#Carbone2015wh">93</a>]; Samza and Kafka Streams replicate state
        changes by sending them to a dedicated Kafka topic with log compaction, similar to change data
        capture [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch11.html#SamzaState">84</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Warski2016tm-marker" href="ch11.html#Warski2016tm">100</a>].
        VoltDB replicates state by redundantly processing each input message on several nodes (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_serial">“Actual Serial Execution”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>In some cases, it may not even be necessary to replicate the state, because it can be rebuilt from
        the input streams. For example, if the state consists of aggregations over a fairly short window, it
        may be fast enough to simply replay the input events corresponding to that window. If the state is a
        local replica of a database, maintained by change data capture, the database can also be rebuilt
        from the log-compacted change stream (see <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_stream_log_compaction">“Log compaction”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>However, all of these trade-offs depend on the performance characteristics of the underlying
        infrastructure: in some systems, network delay may be lower than disk access latency, and network
        bandwidth may be comparable to disk bandwidth. There is no universally ideal trade-off for all
        situations, and the merits of local versus remote state may also shift as storage and networking
        technologies evolve.

        In some ways, stream processing is very much like the batch processing we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>,
        but done continuously on unbounded (never-ending) streams rather than on a fixed-size input. From
        this perspective, message brokers and event logs serve as the streaming equivalent of a filesystem.</p>
        
        <p>We spent some time comparing two types of message brokers:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>AMQP/JMS-style message broker</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>The broker assigns individual messages to consumers, and consumers acknowledge individual messages
        when they have been successfully processed. Messages are deleted from the broker once they have
        been acknowledged. This approach is appropriate as an asynchronous form of RPC (see also
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_msg">“Message-Passing Dataflow”</a>), for example in a task queue, where the exact order of message
        processing is not important and where there is no need to go back and read old messages again
        after they have been processed.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Log-based message broker</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>The broker assigns all messages in a partition to the same consumer node, and always delivers
        messages in the same order. Parallelism is achieved through partitioning, and consumers track
        their progress by checkpointing the offset of the last message they have processed. The broker
        retains messages on disk, so it is possible to jump back and reread old messages if necessary.</p>
        </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>The log-based approach has similarities to the replication logs found in databases (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch_replication">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>) and log-structured storage engines (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch_storage">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>). We saw that this
        approach is especially appropriate for stream processing systems that consume input streams and
        generate derived state or derived output streams.</p>
        
        <p>In terms of where streams come from, we discussed several possibilities: user activity events,
        sensors providing periodic readings, and data feeds (e.g., market data in finance) are naturally
        represented as streams. We saw that it can also be useful to think of the writes to a database as a
        stream: we can capture the changelog—i.e., the history of all changes made to a database—either
        implicitly through change data capture or explicitly through event sourcing. Log compaction allows
        the stream to retain a full copy of the contents of a database.</p>
        
        <p>Representing databases as streams opens up powerful opportunities for integrating systems. You can
        keep derived data systems such as search indexes, caches, and analytics systems continually
        up to date by consuming the log of changes and applying them to the derived system. You can even
        build fresh views onto existing data by starting from scratch and consuming the log of changes from
        the beginning all the way to the present.</p>
        
        <p>The facilities for maintaining state as streams and replaying messages are also the basis for the
        techniques that enable stream joins and fault tolerance in various stream processing frameworks.
        We discussed several purposes of stream processing, including searching for event patterns (complex
        event processing), computing windowed aggregations (stream analytics), and keeping derived data
        systems up to date (materialized views).</p>
        
        <p>We then discussed the difficulties of reasoning about time in a stream processor, including the
        distinction between processing time and event timestamps, and the problem of dealing with straggler
        events that arrive after you thought your window was complete.</p>
        
        <p>We distinguished three types of joins that may appear in stream processes:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>Stream-stream joins</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Both input streams consist of activity events, and the join operator searches for related events
        that occur within some window of time. For example, it may match two actions taken by the same
        user within 30 minutes of each other.
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="self-joins" id="idm45085099936032"></a> The two join inputs may in fact be the same stream (a <em>self-join</em>) if you want
        to find related events within that one stream.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Stream-table joins</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>One input stream consists of activity events, while the other is a database changelog. The
        changelog keeps a local copy of the database up to date. For each activity event, the join
        operator queries the database and outputs an enriched activity event.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Table-table joins</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Both input streams are database changelogs. In this case, every change on one side is joined with
        the latest state of the other side. The result is a stream of changes to the materialized view of
        the join between the two tables.</p>
        </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>Finally, we discussed techniques for achieving fault tolerance and exactly-once semantics in a
        stream processor. As with batch processing, we need to discard the partial output of any failed
        tasks. However, since a stream process is long-running and produces output continuously, we can’t
        simply discard all output. Instead, a finer-grained recovery mechanism can be used, based on
        microbatching, checkpointing, transactions, or idempotent writes.

        scheme in which two consumers share the work of processing a partition by having both read the
        full set of messages, but one of them only considers messages with even-numbered offsets while the other
        deals with the odd-numbered offsets. Alternatively, you could spread message processing over a thread pool, but
        that approach complicates consumer offset management. In general, single-threaded processing of a
        partition is preferable, and parallelism can be increased by using more partitions.</p><p xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="footnote" id="idm45085100290208"><sup><a href="ch11.html#idm45085100290208-marker">ii</a></sup> Thank you to Kostas Kloudas from
