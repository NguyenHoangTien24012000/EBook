        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="storage engines" id="ix_store"></a>
        On the most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it
        should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you.</p>
        
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch_datamodels">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> we discussed data models and query languages—i.e., the format in which you (the
        application developer) give the database your data, and the mechanism by which you can ask for it
        again later. In this chapter we discuss the same from the database’s point of view: how we can store
        the data that we’re given, and how we can find it again when we’re asked for it.</p>
        
        <p>Why should you, as an application developer, care how the database handles storage and retrieval
        internally? You’re probably not going to implement your own storage engine from scratch, but you
        <em>do</em> need to select a storage engine that is appropriate for your application, from the many that
        are available. In order to tune a storage engine to perform well on your kind of workload, you need
        to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood.</p>
        
        <p>In particular, there is a big difference between storage engines that are optimized for
        transactional workloads and those that are optimized for analytics. We will explore that distinction
        later in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_storage_analytics">“Transaction Processing or Analytics?”</a>, and in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_storage_column">“Column-Oriented Storage”</a> we’ll discuss a
        family of storage engines that <span class="keep-together">is optimized</span> for analytics.</p>
        
        <p>However, first we’ll start this chapter by talking about storage engines that are used in the kinds
        of databases that you’re probably familiar with: traditional relational databases, and also most
        so-called NoSQL databases. We will examine two families of storage engines: <em>log-structured</em> storage
        engines, and <em>page-oriented</em> storage engines such as B-trees.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Structures That Power Your Database"><div class="sect1" id="sec_storage_oltp">
        <h1>Data Structures That Power Your Database</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="storage engines" data-secondary="row-oriented" id="ix_storedatastruct"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bash shell (Unix)" id="idm45085122745808"></a>
        Consider the world’s simplest database, implemented as two Bash functions:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="bash"><code class="c">#!/bin/bash</code>
        
        db_set <code class="o">()</code> <code class="o">{</code>
            <code class="nb">echo</code> <code class="s2">"</code><code class="nv">$1</code><code class="s2">,</code><code class="nv">$2</code><code class="s2">"</code> &gt;&gt; database
        <code class="o">}</code>
        
        db_get <code class="o">()</code> <code class="o">{</code>
            grep <code class="s2">"^</code><code class="nv">$1</code><code class="s2">,"</code> database <code class="p">|</code> sed -e <code class="s2">"s/^</code><code class="nv">$1</code><code class="s2">,//"</code> <code class="p">|</code> tail -n 1
        <code class="o">}</code></pre>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="key-value stores" id="idm45085122744016"></a>
        These two functions implement a key-value store. You can call <code>db_set key value</code>, which will store
        <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in the database. The key and value can be (almost) anything you like—for
        example, the value could be a JSON document. You can then call <code>db_get key</code>, which looks up the most
        recent value associated with that particular key and returns it.</p>
        
        <p>And it works:</p>
        <pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>db_set 123456 '{"name":"London","attractions":["Big Ben","London Eye"]}'</strong>
        
        $ <strong>db_set 42 '{"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Golden Gate Bridge"]}'</strong>
        
        $ <strong>db_get 42</strong>
        {"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Golden Gate Bridge"]}
        </pre>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CSV (comma-separated values)" id="idm45085122714656"></a>
        The underlying storage format is very simple: a text file where each line contains a key-value pair,
        separated by a comma (roughly like a CSV file, ignoring escaping issues). Every call to <code>db_set</code>
        appends to the end of the file, so if you update a key several times, the old versions of the value
        are not overwritten—you need to look at the last occurrence of a key in a file to find the latest
        value (hence the <code>tail -n 1</code> in <code>db_get</code>):</p>
        <pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>db_set 42 '{"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Exploratorium"]}'</strong>
        
        $ <strong>db_get 42</strong>
        {"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Exploratorium"]}
        
        $ <strong>cat database</strong>
        123456,{"name":"London","attractions":["Big Ben","London Eye"]}
        42,{"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Golden Gate Bridge"]}
        42,{"name":"San Francisco","attractions":["Exploratorium"]}
        </pre>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logs (data structure)" data-secondary="log-structured storage" id="ix_logstructured"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="append-only files" data-see="logs" id="idm45085122681696"></a>
        Our <code>db_set</code> function actually has pretty good performance for something that is so simple, because
        appending to a file is generally very efficient. Similarly to what <code>db_set</code> does, many databases
        internally use a <em>log</em>, which is an append-only data file. Real databases have more issues to deal
        with (such as concurrency control, reclaiming disk space so that the log doesn’t grow forever, and
        handling errors and partially written records), but the basic principle is the same. Logs are
        incredibly useful, and we will encounter them several times in the rest of this book.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logs (data structure)" id="idm45085122677920"></a>
        The word <em>log</em> is often used to refer to application logs, where an application outputs text that
        describes what’s happening. In this book, <em>log</em> is used in the more general sense: an append-only
        sequence of records. It doesn’t have to be human-readable; it might be binary and intended only for
        other programs to read.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>On the other hand, our <code>db_get</code> function has terrible performance if you have a large number of
        records in your database. Every time you want to look up a key, <code>db_get</code> has to scan the entire
        database file from beginning to end, looking for occurrences of the key. In algorithmic terms, the
        cost of a lookup is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>): if you double the number of records <em>n</em> in your database, a lookup
        takes twice as long. That’s not good.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" id="idm45085122672464"></a>
        In order to efficiently find the value for a particular key in the database, we need a different
        data structure: an <em>index</em>. In this chapter we will look at a range of indexing structures and see
        how they compare; the general idea behind them is to keep some additional metadata on the side,
        which acts as a signpost and helps you to locate the data you want. If you want to search the same
        data in several different ways, you may need several different indexes on different parts of the
        data.</p>
        
        <p>An index is an <em>additional</em> structure that is derived from the primary data. Many databases allow
        you to add and remove indexes, and this doesn’t affect the contents of the database; it only affects
        the performance of queries. Maintaining additional structures incurs overhead, especially on writes. For
        writes, it’s hard to beat the performance of simply appending to a file, because that’s the simplest
        possible write operation. Any kind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also needs
        to be updated every time data is written.</p>
        
        <p>This is an important trade-off in storage systems: well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but
        every index slows down writes. For this reason, databases don’t usually index everything by default,
        but require you—the application developer or database administrator—to choose indexes
        manually, using your knowledge of the application’s typical query patterns. You can then choose the
        indexes that give your application the greatest benefit, without introducing more overhead than
        necessary.</p>

        Let’s start with indexes for key-value data. This is not the only kind of data you can index, but
        it’s very common, and it’s a useful building block for more complex indexes.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="memory" data-secondary="use by indexes" id="idm45085122658752"></a>
        Key-value stores are quite similar to the <em>dictionary</em> type that you can find in most programming
        languages, and which is usually implemented as a hash map (hash table). Hash maps are described in
        many algorithms textbooks
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Aho1983vj-marker" href="ch03.html#Aho1983vj">1</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Cormen2009uw-marker" href="ch03.html#Cormen2009uw">2</a>],
        so we won’t go into detail of how they work here. Since we already have hash maps for our in-memory
        data structures, why not use them to index our data on disk?</p>
        
        <p>Let’s say our data storage consists only of appending to a file, as in the preceding example. Then
        the simplest possible indexing strategy is this: keep an in-memory hash map where every key is
        mapped to a byte offset in the data file—the location at which the value can be found, as
        illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_csv_hash_index">Figure&nbsp;3-1</a>. Whenever you append a new key-value pair to the file,
        you also update the hash map to reflect the offset of the data you just wrote (this works both for
        inserting new keys and for updating existing keys).  When you want to look up a value, use the hash
        map to find the offset in the data file, seek to that location, and read the value.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Bitcask (storage engine)" id="idm45085122649712"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Riak (database)" data-secondary="Bitcask storage engine" id="idm45085122648864"></a>
        This may sound simplistic, but it is a viable approach. In fact, this is essentially what Bitcask
        (the default storage engine in Riak) does
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Sheehy2010uy-marker" href="ch03.html#Sheehy2010uy">3</a>].
        Bitcask offers high-performance reads and writes, subject to the requirement that all the keys fit
        in the available RAM, since the hash map is kept completely in memory. The values can use more space
        than there is available memory, since they can be loaded from disk with just one disk seek. If that part of
        the data file is already in the filesystem cache, a read doesn’t require any disk I/O at all.</p>
        
        <p>A storage engine like Bitcask is well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated
        frequently. For example, the key might be the URL of a cat video, and the value might be the number
        of times it has been played (incremented every time someone hits the play button). In this kind of
        workload, there are a lot of writes, but there are not too many distinct keys—you have a large
        number of writes per key, but it’s feasible to keep all keys in memory.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compaction" data-secondary="of log-structured storage" id="idm45085122644224"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logs (data structure)" data-secondary="compaction" id="idm45085122643056"></a>
        As described so far, we only ever append to a file—so how do we avoid eventually running out of
        disk space? A good solution is to break the log into segments of a certain size by closing a segment
        file when it reaches a certain size, and making subsequent writes to a new segment file. We can then
        perform <em>compaction</em> on these segments, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_compaction">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a>. Compaction
        means throwing away duplicate keys in the log, and keeping only the most recent update for each key.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="fig_storage_compaction" class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781491903063/files/assets/ddia_0302.png" alt="ddia 0302" width="2880" height="1047">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-2. </span>Compaction of a key-value update log (counting the number of times each cat video was played), retaining only the most recent value for each key.</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="threads (concurrency)" data-secondary="background threads" id="idm45085122637904"></a>
        Moreover, since compaction often makes segments much smaller (assuming that a key is overwritten
        several times on average within one segment), we can also merge several segments together at the
        same time as performing the compaction, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_merging">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>. Segments are never
        modified after they have been written, so the merged segment is written to a new file. The merging
        and compaction of segments can be done in a background thread, and while it is going on, we can
        still continue to serve read requests using the old segment files, and write requests to the latest
        segment file. After the merging process is complete, we switch read requests to using the new merged
        segment instead of the old segments—and then the old segment files can simply be deleted.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="fig_storage_merging" class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781491903063/files/assets/ddia_0303.png" alt="ddia 0303" width="2880" height="1477">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-3. </span>Performing compaction and segment merging simultaneously.</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Each segment now has its own in-memory hash table, mapping keys to file offsets. In order to find
        the value for a key, we first check the most recent segment’s hash map; if the key is not present we
        check the second-most-recent segment, and so on. The merging process keeps the number of segments
        small, so lookups don’t need to check many hash maps.</p>
        
        <p>Lots of detail goes into making this simple idea work in practice. Briefly, some of the
        issues that are important in a real implementation are:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>File format</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>CSV is not the best format for a log. It’s faster and simpler to use a binary format that first
        encodes the length of a string in bytes, followed by the raw string (without need for escaping).</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Deleting records</dt>
        <dd>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tombstones" id="idm45085122628560"></a>
        If you want to delete a key and its associated value, you have to append a special deletion record
        to the data file (sometimes called a <em>tombstone</em>). When log segments are merged, the tombstone
        tells the merging process to discard any previous values for the deleted key.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Crash recovery</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>If the database is restarted, the in-memory hash maps are lost. In principle, you can restore each
        segment’s hash map by reading the entire segment file from beginning to end and noting the offset
        of the most recent value for every key as you go along. However, that might take a long time if
        the segment files are large, which would make server restarts painful.
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Bitcask (storage engine)" data-secondary="crash recovery" id="idm45085122625344"></a>
        Bitcask speeds up recovery by storing a snapshot of each segment’s hash map on disk, which can be
        loaded into memory more quickly.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Partially written records</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>The database may crash at any time, including halfway through appending a record to the log.
        Bitcask files include checksums, allowing such corrupted parts of the log to be detected and
        ignored.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Concurrency control</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>As writes are appended to the log in a strictly sequential order, a common implementation choice
        is to have only one writer thread. Data file segments are append-only and otherwise immutable, so
        they can be read concurrently by multiple threads.</p>
        </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>An append-only log seems wasteful at first glance: why don’t you update the file in place,
        overwriting the old value with the new value? But an append-only design turns out to be good for
        several reasons:</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="solid state drives (SSDs)" data-secondary="sequential write throughput" id="idm45085122618400"></a>
        Appending and segment merging are sequential write operations, which are generally much faster
        than random writes, especially on magnetic spinning-disk hard drives. To some extent sequential
        writes are also preferable on flash-based <em>solid state drives</em> (SSDs)
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Li2010te-marker" href="ch03.html#Li2010te">4</a>]. We will discuss this issue further in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_storage_btree_lsm_comparison">“Comparing B-Trees and LSM-Trees”</a>.</p>

        Concurrency and crash recovery are much simpler if segment files are append-only or immutable. For
        example, you don’t have to worry about the case where a crash happened while a value was being
        overwritten, leaving you with a file containing part of the old and part of the new value spliced
        together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Merging old segments avoids the problem of data files getting fragmented over time.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>However, the hash table index also has limitations:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>The hash table must fit in memory, so if you have a very large number of keys, you’re out of luck.
        In principle, you could maintain a hash map on disk, but unfortunately it is difficult to make an
        on-disk hash map perform well. It requires a lot of random access I/O, it is expensive to grow
        when it becomes full, and hash collisions require fiddly logic
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Graefe2011kk-marker" href="ch03.html#Graefe2011kk">5</a>].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Range queries are not efficient. For example, you cannot easily scan over all keys
        between <code>kitty00000</code> and <code>kitty99999</code>—you’d have to look up each key individually in the hash
        maps.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In the next section we will look at an indexing structure that doesn’t have those limitations.

        In <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_merging">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>, each log-structured storage segment is a sequence of key-value pairs.
        These pairs appear in the order that they were written, and values later in the log take precedence
        over values for the same key earlier in the log. Apart from that, the order of key-value pairs in
        the file does not matter.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SSTables (storage format)" id="ix_sstables"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SSTables (storage format)" data-secondary="advantages over hash indexes" id="idm45085122589872"></a>
        Now we can make a simple change to the format of our segment files: we require that the sequence of
        key-value pairs is <em>sorted by key</em>. We call this format <em>Sorted String Table</em>, or <em>SSTable</em> for
        short. With this format, we cannot append new key-value pairs to the segment immediately, since
        writes can occur in any order; we will see shortly how to write SSTable segments using sequential
        I/O.</p>
        
        <p>SSTables have several big advantages over log segments with hash indexes:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithms" data-secondary="mergesort" id="idm45085122585920"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="merging sorted files" id="idm45085122584944"></a>
        Merging segments is simple and efficient, even if the files are bigger than the available memory.
        The approach is like the one used in the <em>mergesort</em> algorithm and is illustrated in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_sstable_merging">Figure&nbsp;3-4</a>: you start reading the input files side by side, look at the first
        key in each file, copy the lowest key (according to the sort order) to the output file, and repeat.
        This produces a new merged segment file, also sorted by key.</p>

        </div></figure>
        
        <p>What if the same key appears in several input segments? Remember that each segment contains all the
        values written to the database during some period of time. This means that all the values in one
        input segment must be more recent than all the values in the other segment (assuming that we always
        merge adjacent segments). When multiple segments contain the same key, we can keep the value from
        the most recent segment and discard the values in older segments.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="memory" data-secondary="use by indexes" id="idm45085122578928"></a>
        In order to find a particular key in the file, you no longer need to keep an index of all the
        keys in memory. See <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_sstable_index">Figure&nbsp;3-5</a> for an example: say you’re looking for the key
        <code>handiwork</code>, but you don’t know the exact offset of that key in the segment file. However, you do
        know the offsets for the keys <code>handbag</code> and <code>handsome</code>, and because of the sorting you know that
        <code>handiwork</code> must appear between those two. This means you can jump to the offset for <code>handbag</code> and scan from
        there until you find <code>handiwork</code> (or not, if the key is not present in the file).</p>

        <p>You still need an in-memory index to tell you the offsets for some of the keys, but it can be
        sparse: one key for every few kilobytes of segment file is sufficient, because a few kilobytes can
        be scanned very quickly.<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085122571440-marker" href="ch03.html#idm45085122571440">i</a></sup></p>

        <p>Since read requests need to scan over several key-value pairs in the requested range anyway, it
        is possible to group those records into a block and compress it before writing it to disk (indicated
        by the shaded area in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_sstable_index">Figure&nbsp;3-5</a>). Each entry of the sparse in-memory index then
        points at the start of a compressed block. Besides saving disk space, compression also reduces the
        I/O bandwidth use.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SSTables (storage format)" data-secondary="constructing and maintaining" id="idm45085122566400"></a>
        Fine so far—but how do you get your data to be sorted by key in the first place? Our incoming
        writes can occur in any order.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithms" data-secondary="red-black trees" id="idm45085122564816"></a>
        Maintaining a sorted structure on disk is possible (see <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_storage_b_trees">“B-Trees”</a>), but maintaining it
        in memory is much easier. There are plenty of well-known tree data structures that you can use, such
        as red-black trees or AVL trees [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Cormen2009uw">2</a>]. With
        these data structures, you can insert keys in any order and read them back in sorted order.</p>
        
        <p>We can now make our storage engine work as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="memtable (in LSM-trees)" id="idm45085122560432"></a>
        When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree data structure (for example, a
        red-black tree). This in-memory tree is sometimes called a <em>memtable</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold—typically a few megabytes—write it out to
        disk as an SSTable file. This can be done efficiently because the tree already maintains the
        key-value pairs sorted by key. The new SSTable file becomes the most recent segment of the
        database. While the SSTable is being written out to disk, writes can continue to a new memtable instance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>In order to serve a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most
        recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>From time to time, run a merging and compaction process in the background to combine segment files
        and to discard overwritten or deleted values.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This scheme works very well. It only suffers from one problem: if the database crashes, the most
        recent writes (which are in the memtable but not yet written out to disk) are lost. In order to
        avoid that problem, we can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended,
        just like in the previous section. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesn’t matter, because
        its only purpose is to restore the memtable after a crash. Every time the memtable is written out to
        an SSTable, the corresponding log can be discarded.</p>

        The algorithm described here is essentially what is used in LevelDB
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="LevelDB2014-marker" href="ch03.html#LevelDB2014">6</a>] and RocksDB

        libraries that are designed to be embedded into other applications.
        Among other things, LevelDB can be used in Riak as an alternative to Bitcask.
        Similar storage engines are used in Cassandra and HBase
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Bertozzi2012wu-marker" href="ch03.html#Bertozzi2012wu">8</a>], both of which were inspired by

        <em>memtable</em>).</p>
        
        <p>Originally this indexing structure was described by Patrick O’Neil et al. under the name
        <em>Log-Structured Merge-Tree</em> (or LSM-Tree) [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="ONeil1996iq-marker" href="ch03.html#ONeil1996iq">10</a>],

        Storage engines that are based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files are often
        called LSM storage engines.</p>

        Lucene, an indexing engine for full-text search used by Elasticsearch and Solr, uses a similar
        method for storing its <em>term dictionary</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Grand2013ws-marker" href="ch03.html#Grand2013ws">12</a>,

        A full-text index is much more complex than a key-value index but is based on a similar idea:
        given a word in a search query, find all the documents (web pages, product descriptions, etc.) that
        mention the word. This is implemented with a key-value structure where the key is a word (a <em>term</em>)
        and the value is the list of IDs of all the documents that contain the word (the <em>postings list</em>).
        In Lucene, this mapping from term to postings list is kept in SSTable-like sorted files, which are
        merged in the background as needed

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Bloom filter (algorithm)" id="idm45085122509872"></a>
        As always, a lot of detail goes into making a storage engine perform well in practice. For example,
        the LSM-tree algorithm can be slow when looking up keys that do not exist in the database: you have
        to check the memtable, then the segments all the way back to the oldest (possibly having to read
        from disk for each one) before you can be sure that the key does not exist. In order to optimize
        this kind of access, storage engines often use additional <em>Bloom filters</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Bloom1970gl-marker" href="ch03.html#Bloom1970gl">15</a>].
        (A Bloom filter is a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set. It
        can tell you if a key does not appear in the database, and thus saves many unnecessary disk reads
        for nonexistent keys.)</p>

        There are also different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables are compacted
        and merged. The most common options are <em>size-tiered</em> and <em>leveled</em> compaction. LevelDB and RocksDB
        use leveled compaction (hence the name of LevelDB), HBase uses size-tiered, and Cassandra supports both
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="CassandraCompaction-marker" href="ch03.html#CassandraCompaction">16</a>]. In size-tiered
        compaction, newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables. In
        leveled compaction, the key range is split up into smaller SSTables and older data is moved into
        separate “levels,” which allows the compaction to proceed more incrementally and use less disk
        space.</p>
        
        <p>Even though there are many subtleties, the basic idea of LSM-trees—keeping a cascade of SSTables
        that are merged in the background—is simple and effective. Even when the dataset is much bigger
        than the available memory it continues to work well. Since data is stored in sorted order, you can efficiently
        perform range queries (scanning all keys above some minimum and up to some maximum), and because the
        disk writes are sequential the LSM-tree can support remarkably high write throughput.

        The log-structured indexes we have discussed so far are gaining acceptance, but they are not the
        most common type of index. The most widely used indexing structure is quite different: the <em>B-tree</em>.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="relational databases" data-secondary="use of B-tree indexes" id="idm45085122476784"></a>
        Introduced in 1970 [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Bayer1970tq-marker" href="ch03.html#Bayer1970tq">17</a>] and called “ubiquitous” less than 10 years later
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Comer1979uy-marker" href="ch03.html#Comer1979uy">18</a>],
        B-trees have stood the test of time very well. They remain the standard index implementation in
        almost all relational databases, and many nonrelational databases use them too.</p>
        
        <p>Like SSTables, B-trees keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key-value lookups
        and range queries. But that’s where the similarity ends: B-trees have a very different design
        philosophy.</p>
        
        <p>The log-structured indexes we saw earlier break the database down into variable-size <em>segments</em>,
        typically several megabytes or more in size, and always write a segment sequentially. By contrast,
        B-trees break the database down into fixed-size <em>blocks</em> or <em>pages</em>, traditionally 4&nbsp;KB in size
        (sometimes  bigger), and read or write one page at a time. This design corresponds more closely to
        the underlying hardware, as disks are also arranged in fixed-size blocks.</p>
        
        <p>Each page can be identified using an address or location, which allows one page to refer to
        another—similar to a pointer, but on disk instead of in memory. We can use these page references to
        construct a tree of pages, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_b_tree">Figure&nbsp;3-6</a>.</p>

        </div></figure>
        
        <p>One page is designated as the <em>root</em> of the B-tree; whenever you want to look up a key in the index,
        you start here. The page contains several keys and references to child pages.
        Each child is responsible for a continuous range of keys, and the keys between the references indicate
        where the boundaries between those ranges lie.</p>
        
        <p>In the example in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_b_tree">Figure&nbsp;3-6</a>, we are looking for the key 251, so we know that we need to
        follow the page reference between the boundaries 200 and 300. That takes us to a similar-looking
        page that further breaks down the 200–300 range into subranges. Eventually we get down to a
        page containing individual keys (a <em>leaf page</em>), which either contains the value for each key
        inline or contains references to the pages where the values can be found.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="B-trees (indexes)" data-secondary="branching factor" id="idm45085122461232"></a>
        The number of references to child pages in one page of the B-tree is called the <em>branching factor</em>.
        For example, in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_b_tree">Figure&nbsp;3-6</a> the branching factor is six. In practice, the branching
        factor depends on the amount of space required to store the page references and the range
        boundaries, but typically it is several hundred.</p>

        If you want to update the value for an existing key in a B-tree, you search for the leaf page
        containing that key, change the value in that page, and write the page back to disk (any references
        to that page remain valid). If you want to add a new key, you need to find the page whose range
        encompasses the new key and add it to that page. If there isn’t enough free space in the page to
        accommodate the new key, it is split into two half-full pages, and the parent page is updated to
        account for the new subdivision of key ranges—see

        <p>This algorithm ensures that the tree remains <em>balanced</em>: a B-tree with <em>n</em> keys always has a depth
        of <em>O</em>(log&nbsp;<em>n</em>). Most databases can fit into a B-tree that is three or four levels deep, so
        you don’t need to follow many page references to find the page you are looking for. (A four-level
        tree of 4&nbsp;KB pages with a branching factor of 500 can store up to 250&nbsp;TB.)</p>

        <h3>Making B-trees reliable</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="B-trees (indexes)" data-secondary="crash recovery" id="idm45085122447728"></a>
        The basic underlying write operation of a B-tree is to overwrite a page on disk with new data. It is
        assumed that the overwrite does not change the location of the page; i.e., all references to that
        page remain intact when the page is overwritten. This is in stark contrast to log-structured indexes
        such as LSM-trees, which only append to files (and eventually delete obsolete files) but never
        modify files in place.</p>
        
        <p>You can think of overwriting a page on disk as an actual hardware operation. On a magnetic hard
        drive, this means moving the disk head to the right place, waiting for the right position on the
        spinning platter to come around, and then overwriting the appropriate sector with new data. On SSDs,
        what happens is somewhat more complicated, due to the fact that an SSD must erase and rewrite
        fairly large blocks of a storage chip at a time
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Goossaert2014wj-marker" href="ch03.html#Goossaert2014wj">19</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, some operations require several different pages to be overwritten. For example, if you
        split a page because an insertion caused it to be overfull, you need to write the two pages that
        were split, and also overwrite their parent page to update the references to the two child pages.
        This is a dangerous operation, because if the database crashes after only some of the pages have
        been written, you end up with a corrupted index (e.g., there may be an <em>orphan</em> page that is not a
        child of any parent).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consistency" data-secondary="crash recovery" id="idm45085122441408"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="corruption of data" data-secondary="preventing using write-ahead logs" id="idm45085122438560"></a>
        In order to make the database resilient to crashes, it is common for B-tree implementations to
        include an additional data structure on disk: a <em>write-ahead log</em> (WAL, also known as a <em>redo log</em>).
        This is an append-only file to which every B-tree modification must be written before it can be
        applied to the pages of the tree itself. When the database comes back up after a crash, this log is
        used to restore the B-tree back to a consistent state
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Graefe2011kk">5</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Mohan1992wo-marker" href="ch03.html#Mohan1992wo">20</a>].</p>
        
        <p>An additional complication of updating pages in place is that careful concurrency control is
        required if multiple threads are going to access the B-tree at the same time—otherwise a thread may
        see the tree in an inconsistent state. This is typically done by protecting the tree’s data
        structures with <em>latches</em> (lightweight locks). Log-structured approaches are simpler in this regard,
        because they do all the merging in the background without interfering with incoming queries and
        atomically swap old segments for new segments from time to time.</p>

        As B-trees have been around for so long, it’s not surprising that many optimizations have been
        developed over the years. To mention just a few:</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="LMDB (storage engine)" id="idm45085122423488"></a>
        Instead of overwriting pages and maintaining a WAL for crash recovery, some databases (like LMDB)
        use a copy-on-write scheme [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Chu2014we-marker" href="ch03.html#Chu2014we">21</a>].
        A modified page is written to a different location, and a new version of the parent pages in the tree
        is created, pointing at the new location. This approach is also useful for <span class="keep-together">concurrency</span> control, as we shall
        see in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_snapshot_isolation">“Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read”</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>We can save space in pages by not storing the entire key, but abbreviating it. Especially in pages
        on the interior of the tree, keys only need to provide enough information to act as boundaries
        between key ranges. Packing more keys into a page allows the tree to have a higher branching
        factor, and thus fewer levels.<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085122417616-marker" href="ch03.html#idm45085122417616">iii</a></sup></p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>In general, pages can be positioned anywhere on disk; there is nothing requiring pages with
        nearby key ranges to be nearby on disk. If a query needs to scan over a large part of the key
        range in sorted order, that page-by-page layout can be inefficient, because a disk seek may be
        required for every page that is read. Many B-tree implementations therefore try to lay out the
        tree so that leaf pages appear in sequential order on disk. However, it’s difficult to maintain
        that order as the tree grows. By contrast, since LSM-trees rewrite large segments of the storage
        in one go during merging, it’s easier for them to keep sequential keys close to each other on disk.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Additional pointers have been added to the tree. For example, each leaf page may have references to
        its sibling pages to the left and right, which allows scanning keys in order without jumping back

        Even though B-tree implementations are generally more mature than LSM-tree implementations,
        LSM-trees are also interesting due to their performance characteristics. As a rule of thumb,
        LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Athanassoulis2016jk-marker" href="ch03.html#Athanassoulis2016jk">23</a>].
        Reads are typically slower on LSM-trees because they have to check several different data structures
        and SSTables at different stages of compaction.</p>
        
        <p>However, benchmarks are often inconclusive and sensitive to details of the workload. You need to
        test systems with your particular workload in order to make a valid comparison. In this section we

        <h3>Advantages of LSM-trees</h3>
        
        <p>A B-tree index must write every piece of data at least twice: once to the write-ahead log, and once
        to the tree page itself (and perhaps again as pages are split). There is also overhead from having
        to write an entire page at a time, even if only a few bytes in that page changed. Some storage
        engines even overwrite the same page twice in order to avoid ending up with a partially updated
        page in the event of a power failure [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Zaitsev2006wa-marker" href="ch03.html#Zaitsev2006wa">24</a>, <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Vondra2016bp-marker" href="ch03.html#Vondra2016bp">25</a>].</p>

        Log-structured indexes also rewrite data multiple times due to repeated compaction and merging of
        SSTables. This effect—one write to the database resulting in multiple writes to the disk over the
        course of the database’s lifetime—is known as <em>write amplification</em>. It is of particular concern
        on SSDs, which can only overwrite blocks a limited number of times before wearing out.</p>
        
        <p>In write-heavy applications, the performance bottleneck might be the rate at which the database can
        write to disk. In this case, write amplification has a direct performance cost: the more that a
        storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle within the available disk
        bandwidth.</p>

        Moreover, LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, partly because they
        sometimes have lower write amplification (although this depends on the storage engine configuration
        and workload), and partly because they sequentially write compact SSTable files rather than having
        to overwrite several pages in the tree
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Callaghan2016wk-marker" href="ch03.html#Callaghan2016wk">26</a>].
        This difference is particularly important on magnetic hard drives, where sequential writes are much
        faster than random writes.</p>
        
        <p>LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees.
        B-tree storage engines leave some disk space unused due to fragmentation: when a page is split or
        when a row cannot fit into an existing page, some space in a page remains unused. Since LSM-trees
        are not page-oriented and periodically rewrite SSTables to remove fragmentation, they have lower
        storage overheads, especially when using leveled compaction
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Callaghan2016cm-marker" href="ch03.html#Callaghan2016cm">27</a>].</p>
        
        <p>On many SSDs, the firmware internally uses a log-structured algorithm to turn random writes into
        sequential writes on the underlying storage chips, so the impact of the storage engine’s write
        pattern is less pronounced [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Goossaert2014wj">19</a>]. However,
        lower write amplification and reduced fragmentation are still advantageous on SSDs: representing
        data more compactly allows more read and write requests within the available I/O bandwidth.</p>

        <h3>Downsides of LSM-trees</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compaction" data-secondary="of log-structured storage" data-tertiary="issues with" id="idm45085122370576"></a>
        A downside of log-structured storage is that the compaction process can sometimes interfere with the
        performance of ongoing reads and writes. Even though storage engines try to perform compaction
        incrementally and without affecting concurrent access, disks have limited resources, so it can
        easily happen that a request needs to wait while the disk finishes an expensive compaction
        operation. The impact on throughput and average response time is usually small, but at higher
        percentiles (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#sec_introduction_percentiles">“Describing Performance”</a>) the response time of queries to log-structured
        storage engines can sometimes be quite high, and B-trees can be more predictable
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Mutsuzaki2011wx-marker" href="ch03.html#Mutsuzaki2011wx">28</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="threads (concurrency)" data-secondary="background threads" id="idm45085122366416"></a>
        Another issue with compaction arises at high write throughput: the disk’s finite write bandwidth
        needs to be shared between the initial write (logging and flushing a
        <span class="keep-together">memtable</span> to disk) and the
        compaction threads running in the background. When writing to an empty database, the full disk
        bandwidth can be used for the initial write, but the bigger the database gets, the more disk
        bandwidth is required for compaction.</p>
        
        <p>If write throughput is high and compaction is not configured carefully, it can happen that
        compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes. In this case, the number of unmerged
        segments on disk keeps growing until you run out of disk space, and reads also slow down because
        they need to check more segment files. Typically, SSTable-based storage engines do not throttle the
        rate of incoming writes, even if compaction cannot keep up, so you need explicit monitoring to
        detect this situation [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Cassandra1608-marker" href="ch03.html#Cassandra1608">29</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="RocksDBTuning-marker" href="ch03.html#RocksDBTuning">30</a>].</p>
        
        <p>An advantage of B-trees is that each key exists in exactly one place in the index, whereas a
        log-structured storage engine may have multiple copies of the same key in different segments. This
        aspect makes B-trees attractive in databases that want to offer strong transactional semantics: in
        many relational databases, transaction isolation is implemented using locks on ranges of keys, and
        in a B-tree index, those locks can be directly attached to the tree
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Graefe2011kk">5</a>]. In
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch_transactions">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> we will discuss this point in more detail.</p>
        
        <p>B-trees are very ingrained in the architecture of databases and provide consistently good
        performance for many workloads, so it’s unlikely that they will go away anytime soon. In new
        datastores, log-structured indexes are becoming increasingly popular. There is no quick and easy
        rule for determining which type of storage engine is better for your use case, so it is worth
        testing empirically.

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="primary keys" id="idm45085122348080"></a>
        So far we have only discussed key-value indexes, which are like a <em>primary key</em> index in the
        relational model. A primary key uniquely identifies one row in a relational table, or one document
        in a document database, or one vertex in a graph database. Other records in the database can refer
        to that row/document/vertex by its primary key (or ID), and the index is used to resolve such
        references.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CREATE INDEX statement (SQL)" id="idm45085122346160"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="secondary indexes" id="idm45085122345168"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="joins" data-secondary="secondary indexes and" id="idm45085122342928"></a>
        It is also very common to have <em>secondary indexes</em>. In relational databases, you can create several
        secondary indexes on the same table using the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> <span class="keep-together">command</span>, and they are often crucial
        for performing joins efficiently. For example, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#fig_billgates_relational">Figure&nbsp;2-1</a> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch_datamodels">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>
        you would most likely have a secondary index on the <code>user_id</code> columns so that you can find all the
        rows belonging to the same user in each of the tables.</p>
        
        <p>A secondary index can easily be constructed from a key-value index. The main difference is that
        in a secondary index, the indexed values are not necessarily unique; that is,
        there might be many rows (documents, vertices) under the same index entry. This can be
        solved in two ways: either by making each value in the index a list of matching row identifiers (like a
        postings list in a full-text index) or by making each entry unique by appending a row identifier to
        it. Either way, both B-trees and log-structured indexes can be used as secondary indexes.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Storing values within the index"><div class="sect3" id="idm45085122336976">
        <h3>Storing values within the index</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="heap files (databases)" id="idm45085122335568"></a>
        The key in an index is the thing that queries search for, but the value can be one of two things:
        it could be the actual row (document, vertex) in question, or it could be a reference to the row
        stored elsewhere. In the latter case, the place where rows are stored is known as a <em>heap file</em>, and
        it stores data in no particular order (it may be append-only, or it may keep track of deleted rows
        in order to overwrite them with new data later). The heap file approach is common because it avoids
        duplicating data when multiple secondary indexes are present: each index just references a location
        in the heap file, and the actual data is kept in one place.</p>
        
        <p>When updating a value without changing the key, the heap file approach can be quite efficient: the
        record can be overwritten in place, provided that the new value is not larger than the old value.
        The situation is more complicated if the new value is larger, as it probably needs to be moved to a
        new location in the heap where there is enough space. In that case, either all indexes need to be
        updated to point at the new heap location of the record, or a forwarding pointer is left behind in
        the old heap location [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Graefe2011kk">5</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="clustered indexes" id="idm45085122331600"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="clustered" id="idm45085122330544"></a>

        In some situations, the extra hop from the index to the heap file is too much of a performance
        penalty for reads, so it can be desirable to store the indexed row directly within an index. This is
        known as a <em>clustered index</em>. For example, in MySQL’s InnoDB storage engine, the primary key of a
        table is always a clustered index, and secondary indexes refer to the primary key (rather than a
        heap file location)
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="MySQL2014-marker" href="ch03.html#MySQL2014">31</a>].
        In SQL Server, you can specify one clustered index per table
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="SQLServer2012-marker" href="ch03.html#SQLServer2012">32</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="covering indexes" id="idm45085122322560"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="covering (with included columns)" id="idm45085122321504"></a>
        A compromise between a clustered index (storing all row data within the index) and a nonclustered
        index (storing only references to the data within the index) is known as a <em>covering index</em> or
        <em>index with included columns</em>, which stores <em>some</em> of a table’s columns within the index
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Webb2008uj-marker" href="ch03.html#Webb2008uj">33</a>].
        This allows some queries to be answered by using the index alone (in which case, the index is said
        to <em>cover</em> the query) [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#SQLServer2012">32</a>].</p>
        
        <p>As with any kind of duplication of data, clustered and covering indexes can speed up reads, but they
        require additional storage and can add overhead on writes. Databases also need to go to additional
        effort to enforce transactional guarantees, because applications should not see inconsistencies due
        to the duplication.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multi-column indexes" id="idm45085122311808"></a>
        The indexes discussed so far only map a single key to a value. That is not sufficient if we need to
        query multiple columns of a table (or multiple fields in a document) simultaneously.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="concatenated indexes" id="idm45085122310512"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="concatenated" id="idm45085122309520"></a>
        The most common type of multi-column index is called a <em>concatenated index</em>, which simply combines
        several fields into one key by appending one column to another (the index definition specifies in
        which order the fields are concatenated). This is like an old-fashioned paper phone book, which
        provides an index from (<em>lastname</em>, <em>firstname</em>) to phone number. Due to the sort order, the index
        can be used to find all the people with a particular last name, or all the people with a particular
        <em>lastname-firstname</em> combination. However, the index is useless if you want to find all the people
        with a particular first name.</p>
        
        <p>Multi-dimensional indexes are a more general way of querying several columns at once, which is
        particularly important for geospatial data. For example, a restaurant-search website may have a
        database containing the latitude and longitude of each restaurant. When a user is looking at the
        restaurants on a map, the website needs to search for all the restaurants within the rectangular map
        area that the user is currently viewing. This requires a two-dimensional range query like the
        following:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="sql"><code class="k">SELECT</code> <code class="o">*</code> <code class="k">FROM</code> <code class="n">restaurants</code> <code class="k">WHERE</code> <code class="n">latitude</code>  <code class="o">&gt;</code> <code class="mi">51</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="mi">4946</code> <code class="k">AND</code> <code class="n">latitude</code>  <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="mi">51</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="mi">5079</code>
                                    <code class="k">AND</code> <code class="n">longitude</code> <code class="o">&gt;</code> <code class="o">-</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="mi">1162</code> <code class="k">AND</code> <code class="n">longitude</code> <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="o">-</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="mi">1004</code><code class="p">;</code></pre>
        
        <p>A standard B-tree or LSM-tree index is not able to answer that kind of query efficiently: it can
        give you either all the restaurants in a range of latitudes (but at any longitude), or all the
        restaurants in a range of longitudes (but anywhere between the North and South poles), but not both
        simultaneously.</p>

        One option is to translate a two-dimensional location into a single number using a space-filling
        curve, and then to use a regular B-tree index
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Ramsak2000wm-marker" href="ch03.html#Ramsak2000wm">34</a>].
        More commonly, specialized spatial indexes such as R-trees are used. For example, PostGIS implements
        geospatial indexes as R-trees using PostgreSQL’s Generalized Search Tree indexing facility
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="PostGIS2014-marker" href="ch03.html#PostGIS2014">35</a>].
        We don’t have space to describe R-trees in detail here, but there is plenty of literature on them.</p>
        
        <p>An interesting idea is that multi-dimensional indexes are not just for geographic locations. For
        example, on an ecommerce website you could use a three-dimensional index on the dimensions (<em>red</em>,
        <em>green</em>, <em>blue</em>) to search for products in a certain range of colors, or in a database of weather
        observations you could have a two-dimensional index on (<em>date</em>, <em>temperature</em>) in order to
        efficiently search for all the observations during the year 2013 where the temperature was between
        25 and 30℃. With a one-dimensional index, you would have to either scan over all the records from
        2013 (regardless of temperature) and then filter them by temperature, or vice versa. A 2D index
        could narrow down by timestamp and temperature simultaneously.

        All the indexes discussed so far assume that you have exact data and allow you to query for exact
        values of a key, or a range of values of a key with a sort order. What they don’t allow you to do is
        search for <em>similar</em> keys, such as misspelled words. Such <em>fuzzy</em> querying requires different
        techniques.</p>

        For example, full-text search engines commonly allow a search for one word to be expanded to include
        synonyms of the word, to ignore grammatical variations of words, and to search for occurrences of words
        near each other in the same document, and support various other features that depend on linguistic analysis
        of the text. To cope with typos in documents or queries, Lucene is able to search text for words
        within a certain edit distance (an edit distance of 1 means that one letter has been added, removed,

        As mentioned in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_storage_lsm_usage">“Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables”</a>, Lucene uses a SSTable-like structure for its term
        dictionary. This structure requires a small in-memory index that tells queries at which offset in
        the sorted file they need to look for a key. In LevelDB, this in-memory index is a sparse collection
        of some of the keys, but in Lucene, the in-memory index is a finite state automaton over the
        characters in the keys, similar to a <em>trie</em>

        <h3>Keeping everything in memory</h3>

        The data structures discussed so far in this chapter have all been answers to the limitations of
        disks. Compared to main memory, disks are awkward to deal with. With both magnetic disks and SSDs,
        data on disk needs to be laid out carefully if you want good performance on reads and writes.
        However, we tolerate this awkwardness because disks have two significant advantages: they are
        durable (their contents are not lost if the power is turned off), and they have a lower cost per
        gigabyte than RAM.</p>
        
        <p>As RAM becomes cheaper, the cost-per-gigabyte argument is eroded. Many datasets are simply not that
        big, so it’s quite feasible to keep them entirely in memory, <span class="keep-together">potentially</span> distributed across several
        machines. This has led to the development of <em>in-memory databases</em>.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="key-value stores" data-secondary="in-memory" id="idm45085122196160"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Memcached (caching server)" id="idm45085122195056"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="caches" id="idm45085122194160"></a>
        Some in-memory key-value stores, such as Memcached, are intended for caching use only, where it’s
        acceptable for data to be lost if a machine is restarted. But other in-memory databases aim for
        durability, which can be achieved with special hardware (such as battery-powered RAM), by writing a
        log of changes to disk, by writing periodic snapshots to disk, or by replicating the in-memory state
        to other machines.</p>
        
        <p>When an in-memory database is restarted, it needs to reload its state, either from disk or over the
        network from a replica (unless special hardware is used). Despite writing to disk, it’s still an
        in-memory database, because the disk is merely used as an append-only log for durability, and reads
        are served entirely from memory. Writing to disk also has operational advantages: files on disk can
        easily be backed up, inspected, and analyzed by external utilities.</p>

        Products such as VoltDB, MemSQL, and Oracle TimesTen are in-memory databases with a relational model,
        and the vendors claim that they can offer big performance improvements by removing all the overheads
        associated with managing on-disk data structures
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Stonebraker2007ub-marker" href="ch03.html#Stonebraker2007ub">41</a>,

        RAMCloud is an open source, in-memory key-value store with durability (using a log-structured

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="performance" data-secondary="of in-memory databases" id="idm45085122177424"></a>
        Counterintuitively, the performance advantage of in-memory databases is not due to the fact that
        they don’t need to read from disk. Even a disk-based storage engine may never need to read from disk
        if you have enough memory, because the operating system caches recently used disk blocks in memory
        anyway. Rather, they can be faster because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data
        structures in a form that can be written to disk
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Harizopoulos2008jb-marker" href="ch03.html#Harizopoulos2008jb">44</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Besides performance, another interesting area for in-memory databases is providing data models that
        are difficult to implement with disk-based indexes. For example, Redis offers a database-like
        interface to various data structures such as priority queues and sets. Because it keeps all data in
        memory, its implementation is comparatively simple.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="virtual memory" data-secondary="versus memory management by databases" id="idm45085122171056"></a>
        Recent research indicates that an in-memory database architecture could be extended to support
        datasets larger than the available memory, without bringing back the overheads of a disk-centric architecture
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="DeBrabant2013ts-marker" href="ch03.html#DeBrabant2013ts">45</a>].
        The so-called <em>anti-caching</em> approach works by evicting the least recently used data from memory to
        disk when there is not enough memory, and loading it back into memory when it is accessed again in
        the future. This is similar to what operating systems do with virtual memory and swap files, but the
        database can manage memory more efficiently than the OS, as it can work at the granularity of
        individual records rather than entire memory pages. This approach still requires indexes to fit
        entirely in memory, though (like the Bitcask example at the beginning of the chapter).</p>

        Further changes to storage engine design will probably be needed if <em>non-volatile memory</em> (NVM)
        technologies become more widely adopted

        In the early days of business data processing, a write to the database typically corresponded to a
        <em>commercial transaction</em> taking place: making a sale, placing an order with a supplier, paying an
        employee’s salary, etc. As databases expanded into areas that didn’t involve money changing hands,
        the term <em>transaction</em> nevertheless stuck, referring to a group of reads and writes that form a
        logical unit.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ACID properties (transactions)" id="idm45085122153504"></a>
        A transaction needn’t necessarily have ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
        properties. <em>Transaction processing</em> just means allowing clients to make low-latency reads and
        writes—as opposed to <em>batch processing</em> jobs, which only run periodically (for example, once per
        day). We discuss the ACID properties in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch_transactions">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> and batch processing in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OLTP (online transaction processing)" id="idm45085122149568"></a>
        Even though databases started being used for many different kinds of data—comments on blog posts,
        actions in a game, contacts in an address book, etc.—the basic access pattern remained similar to
        processing business transactions. An application typically looks up a small number of records by
        some key, using an index. Records are inserted or updated based on the user’s input.  Because these
        applications are interactive, the access pattern became known as <em>online transaction processing</em>
        (OLTP).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="analytics" id="idm45085122147520"></a>
        However, databases also started being increasingly used for <em>data analytics</em>, which has very
        different access patterns. Usually an analytic query needs to scan over a huge number of records,
        only reading a few columns per record, and calculates aggregate statistics (such as count, sum, or
        average) rather than returning the raw data to the user. For example, if your data is a table of
        sales transactions, then analytic queries might be:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>What was the total revenue of each of our stores in January?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>How many more bananas than usual did we sell during our latest promotion?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Which brand of baby food is most often purchased together with brand X <span class="keep-together">diapers?</span></p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OLAP (online analytic processing)" id="idm45085122141792"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="transaction processing" data-secondary="comparison to analytics" id="idm45085122139632"></a>
        These queries are often written by business analysts, and feed into reports that help the management
        of a company make better decisions (<em>business intelligence</em>). In order to differentiate this pattern
        of using databases from transaction processing, it has been called <em>online analytic processing</em>
        (OLAP) [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Codd1993ww-marker" href="ch03.html#Codd1993ww">47</a>].<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085122135776-marker" href="ch03.html#idm45085122135776">iv</a></sup>

        <p>At first, the same databases were used for both transaction processing and analytic queries. SQL
        turned out to be quite flexible in this regard: it works well for OLTP-type queries as well as
        OLAP-type queries. Nevertheless, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a trend for companies
        to stop using their OLTP systems for analytics purposes, and to run the analytics on a separate
        database instead. This separate database was called a <em>data warehouse</em>.</p>

        An enterprise may have dozens of different transaction processing systems: systems
        powering the customer-facing website, controlling point of sale (checkout) systems in physical
        stores, tracking inventory in warehouses, planning routes for vehicles, managing suppliers,
        administering employees, etc. Each of these systems is complex and needs a team of people to
        maintain it, so the systems end up operating mostly autonomously from each other.</p>
        
        <p>These OLTP systems are usually expected to be highly available and to process transactions with low
        latency, since they are often critical to the operation of the business. Database administrators
        therefore closely guard their OLTP databases. They are usually reluctant to let business analysts
        run ad hoc analytic queries on an OLTP database, since those queries are often expensive, scanning
        large parts of the dataset, which can harm the performance of concurrently executing transactions.</p>

        A <em>data warehouse</em>, by contrast, is a separate database that analysts can query to their hearts’
        content, without affecting OLTP operations
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Chaudhuri1997bd-marker" href="ch03.html#Chaudhuri1997bd">48</a>].
        The data warehouse contains a read-only copy of the data in all the various OLTP systems in the
        company. Data is extracted from OLTP databases (using either a periodic data dump or a continuous
        stream of updates), transformed into an analysis-friendly schema, cleaned up, and then loaded into
        the data warehouse. This process of getting data into the warehouse is known as
        <em>Extract–Transform–Load</em> (ETL) and is illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_dwh_etl">Figure&nbsp;3-8</a>.</p>

        <p>Data warehouses now exist in almost all large enterprises, but in small companies they are almost
        unheard of. This is probably because most small companies don’t have so many different OLTP systems,
        and most small companies have a small amount of data—small enough that it can be queried in a
        conventional SQL database, or even analyzed in a spreadsheet. In a large company, a lot of heavy
        lifting is required to do something that is simple in a small company.</p>
        
        <p>A big advantage of using a separate data warehouse, rather than querying OLTP systems directly for
        analytics, is that the data warehouse can be optimized for analytic access patterns. It turns out
        that the indexing algorithms discussed in the first half of this chapter work well for OLTP, but are
        not very good at answering analytic queries. In the rest of this chapter we will look at storage
        engines that are optimized for analytics instead.</p>

        The data model of a data warehouse is most commonly relational, because SQL is generally a good fit
        for analytic queries. There are many graphical data analysis tools that generate SQL queries,
        visualize the results, and allow analysts to explore the data (through operations such as

        <p>On the surface, a data warehouse and a relational OLTP database look similar, because they both have
        a SQL query interface. However, the internals of the systems can look quite different, because they
        are optimized for very different query patterns. Many database vendors now focus on supporting
        either transaction processing or analytics workloads, but not both.</p>

        Some databases, such as Microsoft SQL Server and SAP HANA, have support for transaction processing
        and data warehousing in the same product. However, they are increasingly becoming two separate

        Data warehouse vendors such as Teradata, Vertica, SAP HANA, and ParAccel typically sell their systems
        under expensive commercial licenses. Amazon RedShift is a hosted version of ParAccel. More recently,
        a plethora of open source SQL-on-Hadoop projects have emerged; they are young but aiming to compete
        with commercial data warehouse systems. These include Apache Hive, Spark SQL, Cloudera Impala,

        As explored in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch_datamodels">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>, a wide range of different data models are used in the realm of
        transaction processing, depending on the needs of the application. On the other hand, in analytics,
        there is much less diversity of data models. Many data warehouses are used in a fairly formulaic
        style, known as a <em>star schema</em> (also known as <em>dimensional modeling</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kimball2013tb_ch3-marker" href="ch03.html#Kimball2013tb_ch3">55</a>]).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fact tables" id="idm45085122047616"></a>
        The example schema in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_dwh_schema">Figure&nbsp;3-9</a> shows a data warehouse that might be found at a grocery
        retailer. At the center of the schema is a so-called <em>fact table</em> (in this example, it is called
        <code>fact_sales</code>). Each row of the fact table represents an event that occurred at a particular time
        (here, each row represents a customer’s purchase of a product). If we were analyzing website traffic
        rather than retail sales, each row might represent a page view or a click by a user.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="fig_dwh_schema" class="figure">

        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Usually, facts are captured as individual events, because this allows maximum flexibility of
        analysis later. However, this means that the fact table can become extremely large. A big
        enterprise like Apple, Walmart, or eBay may have tens of petabytes of transaction history in its data
        warehouse, most of which is in fact tables [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Harris2013un-marker" href="ch03.html#Harris2013un">56</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dimension tables" id="idm45085122039184"></a>
        Some of the columns in the fact table are attributes, such as the price at which the product was
        sold and the cost of buying it from the supplier (allowing the profit margin to be calculated).
        Other columns in the fact table are foreign key references to other tables, called <em>dimension
        tables</em>. As each row in the fact table represents an event, the dimensions represent the <em>who</em>,
        <em>what</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>why</em> of the event.</p>
        
        <p>For example, in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_dwh_schema">Figure&nbsp;3-9</a>, one of the dimensions is the product that was sold. Each row in
        the <code>dim_product</code> table represents one type of product that is for sale, including its stock-keeping
        unit (SKU), description, brand name, category, fat content, package size, etc. Each row in the
        <code>fact_sales</code> table uses a foreign key to indicate which product was sold in that particular
        transaction. (For simplicity, if the customer buys several different products at once, they are
        represented as separate rows in the fact table.)</p>
        
        <p>Even date and time are often represented using dimension tables, because this allows additional
        information about dates (such as public holidays) to be encoded, allowing queries to differentiate
        between sales on holidays and non-holidays.</p>
        
        <p>The name “star schema” comes from the fact that when the table relationships are visualized, the
        fact table is in the middle, surrounded by its dimension tables; the connections to these tables are
        like the rays of a star.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="snowflake schemas" id="idm45085122030688"></a>
        A variation of this template is known as the <em>snowflake schema</em>, where dimensions are further broken
        down into subdimensions. For example, there could be separate tables for brands and
        product categories, and each row in the <code>dim_product</code> table could reference the brand and category
        as foreign keys, rather than storing them as strings in the <code>dim_product</code> table. Snowflake schemas
        are more normalized than star schemas, but star schemas are often preferred because
        they are simpler for analysts to work with
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Kimball2013tb_ch3">55</a>].</p>
        
        <p>In a typical data warehouse, tables are often very wide: fact tables often have over 100 columns,
        sometimes several hundred [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#OneSizeFitsNone2013vw">51</a>].
        Dimension tables can also be very wide, as they include all the metadata that may be relevant
        for analysis—for example, the <code>dim_store</code> table may include details of which services are offered
        at each store, whether it has an in-store bakery, the square footage, the date when the store was
        first opened, when it was last remodeled, how far it is from the nearest highway, etc.

        If you have trillions of rows and petabytes of data in your fact tables, storing and querying them
        efficiently becomes a challenging problem. Dimension tables are usually much smaller (millions of
        rows), so in this section we will concentrate primarily on storage of facts.</p>
        
        <p>Although fact tables are often over 100 columns wide, a typical data warehouse query only accesses 4
        or 5 of them at one time (<code>"SELECT *"</code> queries are rarely needed for analytics)
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#OneSizeFitsNone2013vw">51</a>]. Take the query in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_analytics_query">Example&nbsp;3-1</a>: it accesses a large number of rows (every occurrence of someone
        buying fruit or candy during the 2013 calendar year), but it only needs to access three columns of
        the <code>fact_sales</code> table: <code>date_key</code>, <span class="keep-together"><code>product_sk</code></span>,
        and <code>quantity</code>. The query ignores all other columns.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="storage engines" data-secondary="row-oriented" data-tertiary="defined" id="idm45085121902272"></a>
        In most OLTP databases, storage is laid out in a <em>row-oriented</em> fashion: all the values from one row
        of a table are stored next to each other. Document databases are similar: an entire document is
        typically stored as one contiguous sequence of bytes. You can see this in the CSV example of
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_csv_hash_index">Figure&nbsp;3-1</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In order to process a query like <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_storage_analytics_query">Example&nbsp;3-1</a>, you may have indexes on
        <code>fact_sales.date_key</code> and/or <code>fact_sales.product_sk</code> that tell the storage engine where to find
        all the sales for a particular date or for a particular product. But then, a row-oriented storage
        engine still needs to load all of those rows (each consisting of over 100 attributes) from disk into
        memory, parse them, and filter out those that don’t meet the required conditions. That can take a
        long time.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="storage engines" data-secondary="column-oriented" data-tertiary="defined" id="idm45085121896688"></a>
        The idea behind <em>column-oriented storage</em> is simple: don’t store all the values from one row
        together, but store all the values from each <em>column</em> together instead. If each column is stored in
        a separate file, a query only needs to read and parse those columns that are used in that query,
        which can save a lot of work. This principle is illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_column_store">Figure&nbsp;3-10</a>.

        Column storage is easiest to understand in a relational data model, but it applies equally to
        nonrelational data. For example, Parquet [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="LeDem2013wc-marker" href="ch03.html#LeDem2013wc">57</a>] is a columnar storage format that supports a document

        <p>The column-oriented storage layout relies on each column file containing the rows in the same order.
        Thus, if you need to reassemble an entire row, you can take the 23rd entry from each of the
        individual column files and put them together to form the 23rd row of the table.</p>

        Besides only loading those columns from disk that are required for a query, we can further reduce
        the demands on disk throughput by compressing data. Fortunately, column-oriented storage often lends
        itself very well to compression.</p>

        Take a look at the sequences of values for each column in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_column_store">Figure&nbsp;3-10</a>: they often look quite
        repetitive, which is a good sign for compression. Depending on the data in the column, different

        <p>Often, the number of distinct values in a column is small compared to the number of rows (for
        example, a retailer may have billions of sales transactions, but only 100,000 distinct products).
        We can now take a column with <em>n</em> distinct values and turn it into <em>n</em> separate bitmaps: one bitmap
        for each distinct value, with one bit for each row. The bit is 1 if the row has that value, and 0 if
        not.</p>
        
        <p>If <em>n</em> is very small (for example, a <em>country</em> column may have approximately 200 distinct values),
        those bitmaps can be stored with one bit per row. But if <em>n</em> is bigger, there will be a lot of zeros
        in most of the bitmaps (we say that they are <em>sparse</em>). In that case, the bitmaps can additionally
        be run-length encoded, as shown at the bottom of <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_bitmap_index">Figure&nbsp;3-11</a>.  This can make the encoding
        of a column remarkably compact.</p>
        
        <p>Bitmap indexes such as these are very well suited for the kinds of queries that are common in a data
        warehouse. For example:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt><code>WHERE product_sk IN (30, 68, 69):</code></dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Load the three bitmaps for <code>product_sk = 30</code>, <code>product_sk = 68</code>, and <code>product_sk = 69</code>, and
        calculate the bitwise <em>OR</em> of the three bitmaps, which can be done very efficiently.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>WHERE product_sk = 31 AND store_sk = 3:</code></dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Load the bitmaps for <code>product_sk = 31</code> and <code>store_sk = 3</code>, and calculate the bitwise <em>AND</em>. This
        works because the columns contain the rows in the same order, so the <em>k</em>th bit in one column’s
        bitmap corresponds to the same row as the <em>k</em>th bit in another column’s bitmap.</p>

        Cassandra and HBase have a concept of <em>column families</em>, which they inherited from Bigtable
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Chang2006ta_ch3">9</a>]. However, it is very misleading to
        call them column-oriented: within each column family, they store all columns from a row together,
        along with a row key, and they do not use column compression. Thus, the Bigtable model is still
        mostly row-oriented.</p>

        For data warehouse queries that need to scan over millions of rows, a big bottleneck is the
        bandwidth for getting data from disk into memory. However, that is not the only bottleneck.
        Developers of analytical databases also worry about efficiently using the bandwidth from
        main memory into the CPU cache, avoiding branch mispredictions and bubbles in the CPU instruction
        processing pipeline, and making use of single-instruction-multi-data (SIMD) instructions in modern
        CPUs [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Boncz2005ws-marker" href="ch03.html#Boncz2005ws">59</a>,

        Besides reducing the volume of data that needs to be loaded from disk, column-oriented storage
        layouts are also good for making efficient use of CPU cycles. For example, the query engine can take
        a chunk of compressed column data that fits comfortably in the CPU’s L1 cache and iterate through
        it in a tight loop (that is, with no function calls). A CPU can execute such a loop much faster than code
        that requires a lot of function calls and conditions for each record that is processed. Column
        compression allows more rows from a column to fit in the same amount of L1 cache. Operators, such as
        the bitwise <em>AND</em> and <em>OR</em> described previously, can be designed to operate on such chunks of
        compressed column data directly. This technique is known as <em>vectorized processing</em>

        <h2>Sort Order in Column Storage</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="column-oriented storage" data-secondary="sort order in" id="ix_colsort"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sorting" data-secondary="sort order in column storage" id="idm45085121823456"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="storage engines" data-secondary="column-oriented" data-tertiary="sort order in" id="ix_storecolsort"></a>
        In a column store, it doesn’t necessarily matter in which order the rows are stored. It’s easiest to
        store them in the order in which they were inserted, since then inserting a new row just means
        appending to each of the column files. However, we can choose to impose an order, like we did with
        SSTables previously, and use that as an indexing mechanism.</p>
        
        <p>Note that it wouldn’t make sense to sort each column independently, because then we would no longer
        know which items in the columns belong to the same row. We can only reconstruct a row because we
        know that the <em>k</em>th item in one column belongs to the same row as the <em>k</em>th item in another
        column.</p>
        
        <p>Rather, the data needs to be sorted an entire row at a time, even though it is stored by column.
        The administrator of the database can choose the columns by which the table should be sorted, using
        their knowledge of common queries. For example, if queries often target date ranges, such as the
        last month, it might make sense to make <code>date_key</code> the first sort key. Then the query optimizer can
        scan only the rows from the last month, which will be much faster than scanning all rows.</p>
        
        <p>A second column can determine the sort order of any rows that have the same value in the first
        column. For example, if <code>date_key</code> is the first sort key in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_column_store">Figure&nbsp;3-10</a>, it might make
        sense for <code>product_sk</code> to be the second sort key so that all sales for the same product on the same
        day are grouped together in storage. That will help queries that need to group or filter sales by
        product within a certain date range.</p>
        
        <p>Another advantage of sorted order is that it can help with compression of columns. If the primary
        sort column does not have many distinct values, then after sorting, it will have long sequences
        where the same value is repeated many times in a row. A simple run-length encoding, like we used for
        the bitmaps in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_bitmap_index">Figure&nbsp;3-11</a>, could compress that column down to a few kilobytes—even if
        the table has billions of rows.</p>
        
        <p>That compression effect is strongest on the first sort key. The second and third sort keys will be
        more jumbled up, and thus not have such long runs of repeated values. Columns further down the
        sorting priority appear in essentially random order, so they probably won’t compress as well. But
        having the first few columns sorted is still a win overall.</p>

        A clever extension of this idea was introduced in C-Store and adopted in the commercial data
        warehouse Vertica [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Stonebraker2005uf-marker" href="ch03.html#Stonebraker2005uf">61</a>,

        Different queries benefit from different sort orders, so why not store the same data sorted in
        <em>several different</em> ways? Data needs to be replicated to multiple machines anyway, so that you don’t
        lose data if one machine fails. You might as well store that redundant data sorted in different
        ways so that when you’re processing a query, you can use the version that best fits the query
        <span class="keep-together">pattern.</span></p>
        
        <p>Having multiple sort orders in a column-oriented store is a bit similar to having multiple secondary
        indexes in a row-oriented store. But the big difference is that the row-oriented store keeps every
        row in one place (in the heap file or a clustered index), and secondary indexes just contain
        pointers to the matching rows. In a column store, there normally aren’t any pointers to data
        elsewhere, only columns containing values.

        These optimizations make sense in data warehouses, because most of the load consists of large
        read-only queries run by analysts. Column-oriented storage, compression, and sorting all help to make
        those read queries faster. However, they have the downside of making writes more difficult.</p>
        
        <p>An update-in-place approach, like B-trees use, is not possible with compressed columns. If you
        wanted to insert a row in the middle of a sorted table, you would most likely have to rewrite all
        the column files. As rows are identified by their position within a column, the insertion has to
        update all columns consistently.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Vertica (database)" data-secondary="handling writes" id="idm45085121795024"></a>
        Fortunately, we have already seen a good solution earlier in this chapter: LSM-trees. All writes
        first go to an in-memory store, where they are added to a sorted structure and prepared for writing
        to disk. It doesn’t matter whether the in-memory store is row-oriented or column-oriented. When
        enough writes have accumulated, they are merged with the column files on disk and written to new
        files in bulk. This is essentially what Vertica does
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#Lamb2012ub">62</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Queries need to examine both the column data on disk and the recent writes in memory, and combine
        the two. However, the query optimizer hides this distinction from the user. From an analyst’s point
        of view, data that has been modified with inserts, updates, or deletes is immediately reflected in
        subsequent queries.

        Not every data warehouse is necessarily a column store: traditional row-oriented databases and a few
        other architectures are also used. However, columnar storage can be significantly faster for ad hoc
        analytical queries, so it is rapidly gaining popularity
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch03.html#OneSizeFitsNone2013vw">51</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="LeDem2014tl-marker" href="ch03.html#LeDem2014tl">63</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="materialization" data-secondary="aggregate values" id="idm45085121782896"></a>
        Another aspect of data warehouses that is worth mentioning briefly is <em>materialized aggregates</em>. As
        discussed earlier, data warehouse queries often involve an aggregate function, such as <code>COUNT</code>, <code>SUM</code>,
        <code>AVG</code>, <code>MIN</code>, or <code>MAX</code> in SQL. If the same aggregates are used by many different queries, it can be
        wasteful to crunch through the raw data every time. Why not cache some of the counts or sums that
        queries use most often?</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="materialization" data-secondary="materialized views" id="idm45085121778448"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="caches" data-secondary="and materialized views" id="idm45085121777344"></a>
        One way of creating such a cache is a <em>materialized view</em>. In a relational data model, it is often
        defined like a standard (virtual) view: a table-like object whose contents are the results of some
        query. The difference is that a materialized view is an actual copy of the query results, written to
        disk, whereas a virtual view is just a shortcut for writing queries. When you read from a virtual
        view, the SQL engine expands it into the view’s underlying query on the fly and then processes the
        expanded query.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="denormalization (data representation)" data-secondary="materialized views" id="idm45085121775088"></a>
        When the underlying data changes, a materialized view needs to be updated, because it is a
        denormalized copy of the data. The database can do that automatically, but such updates make writes
        more expensive, which is why materialized views are not often used in OLTP databases. In read-heavy
        data warehouses they can make more sense (whether or not they actually improve read performance
        depends on the individual case).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data cubes" id="idm45085121773280"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OLAP (online analytic processing)" data-secondary="data cubes" id="idm45085121772288"></a>
        A common special case of a materialized view is known as a <em>data cube</em> or <em>OLAP cube</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Gray2007he-marker" href="ch03.html#Gray2007he">64</a>].
        It is a grid of aggregates grouped by different dimensions. <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_data_cube">Figure&nbsp;3-12</a> shows an example.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="fig_data_cube" class="figure">

        <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-12. </span>Two dimensions of a data cube, aggregating data by summing.</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Imagine for now that each fact has foreign keys to only two dimension tables—in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_data_cube">Figure&nbsp;3-12</a>, these are <em>date</em> and <em>product</em>. You can now draw a two-dimensional table, with
        dates along one axis and products along the other. Each cell contains the aggregate (e.g., <code>SUM</code>) of
        an attribute (e.g., <code>net_price</code>) of all facts with that date-product combination. Then you can apply
        the same aggregate along each row or column and get a summary that has been reduced by one
        dimension (the sales by product regardless of date, or the sales by date regardless of product).</p>
        
        <p>In general, facts often have more than two dimensions. In <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_dwh_schema">Figure&nbsp;3-9</a> there are five
        dimensions: date, product, store, promotion, and customer. It’s a lot harder to imagine what a
        five-dimensional hypercube would look like, but the principle remains the same: each cell contains
        the sales for a particular date-product-store-promotion-customer combination. These values can then
        repeatedly be summarized along each of the dimensions.</p>
        
        <p>The advantage of a materialized data cube is that certain queries become very fast because they
        have effectively been precomputed. For example, if you want to know the total sales per store
        yesterday, you just need to look at the totals along the appropriate dimension—no need to scan
        millions of rows.</p>
        
        <p>The disadvantage is that a data cube doesn’t have the same flexibility as querying the raw data. For example,
        there is no way of calculating which proportion of sales comes from items that cost more than $100,
        because the price isn’t one of the dimensions. Most data warehouses therefore try to keep as much
        raw data as possible, and use aggregates such as data cubes only as a performance boost for certain
        queries.</p>

        <p>In this chapter we tried to get to the bottom of how databases handle storage and retrieval. What
        happens when you store data in a database, and what does the database do when you query for the
        data again later?</p>
        
        <p>On a high level, we saw that storage engines fall into two broad categories: those optimized for
        transaction processing (OLTP), and those optimized for analytics (OLAP). There are big differences between
        the access patterns in those use cases:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>OLTP systems are typically user-facing, which means that they may see a huge volume of requests.
        In order to handle the load, applications usually only touch a small number of records in each
        query. The application requests records using some kind of key, and the storage engine uses an
        index to find the data for the requested key. Disk seek time is often the bottleneck here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Data warehouses and similar analytic systems are less well known, because they are primarily used
        by business analysts, not by end users. They handle a much lower volume of queries than OLTP
        systems, but each query is typically very demanding, requiring many millions of records to be
        scanned in a short time. Disk bandwidth (not seek time) is often the bottleneck here, and
        column-oriented storage is an increasingly popular solution for this kind of workload.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>On the OLTP side, we saw storage engines from two main schools of thought:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>The log-structured school, which only permits appending to files and deleting obsolete files, but
        never updates a file that has been written. Bitcask, SSTables, LSM-trees, LevelDB, Cassandra,
        HBase, Lucene, and others belong to this group.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The update-in-place school, which treats the disk as a set of fixed-size pages that can be overwritten.
        B-trees are the biggest example of this philosophy, being used in all major relational databases
        and also many nonrelational ones.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Log-structured storage engines are a comparatively recent development. Their key idea is that they
        systematically turn random-access writes into sequential writes on disk, which enables higher write
        throughput due to the performance characteristics of hard drives and SSDs.</p>
        
        <p>Finishing off the OLTP side, we did a brief tour through some more complicated indexing structures,
        and databases that are optimized for keeping all data in memory.</p>
        
        <p>We then took a detour from the internals of storage engines to look at the high-level architecture
        of a typical data warehouse. This background illustrated why analytic workloads are so different
        from OLTP: when your queries require sequentially scanning across a large number of rows, indexes
        are much less relevant. Instead it becomes important to encode data very compactly, to minimize the
        amount of data that the query needs to read from disk. We discussed how column-oriented storage
        helps achieve this goal.</p>
        
        <p>As an application developer, if you’re armed with this knowledge about the internals of storage
        engines, you are in a much better position to know which tool is best suited for your particular
        application. If you need to adjust a database’s tuning parameters, this understanding allows you to
        imagine what effect a higher or a lower value may have.</p>
        
        <p>Although this chapter couldn’t make you an expert in tuning any one particular storage engine, it
        has hopefully equipped you with enough vocabulary and ideas that you can make sense of the
        documentation for the database of your choice.

        values had a fixed size, you could use binary search on a segment file and avoid the in-memory
        index entirely. However, they are usually variable-length in practice, which makes it difficult to
        tell where one record ends and the next one starts if you don’t have an index.</p><p xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="footnote" id="idm45085122455872"><sup><a href="ch03.html#idm45085122455872-marker">ii</a></sup> Inserting a new

        in OLAP is unclear; it probably refers to the fact that queries are not just for predefined reports,
        but that analysts use the OLAP system interactively for explorative queries.</p></div><div data-type="footnotes"><h5>References</h5><p xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="footnote" id="Aho1983vj">[<a href="ch03.html#Aho1983vj-marker">1</a>] Alfred V.
