        of this book, we assembled from the ground up all the major considerations that go into a
        distributed database, from the layout of data on disk all the way to the limits of distributed
        consistency in the presence of faults. However, this discussion assumed that there was only one
        database in the application.</p>
        
        <p>In reality, data systems are often more complex. In a large application you often need to be able to
        access and process data in many different ways, and there is no one database that can satisfy all
        those different needs simultaneously. Applications thus commonly use a combination of several
        different datastores, indexes, caches, analytics systems, etc. and implement mechanisms for moving
        data from one store to another.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integrating different data systems" data-see="data integration" id="idm45085102532464"></a>
        In this final part of the book, we will examine the issues around integrating multiple
        different data systems, potentially with different data models and optimized for different access
        patterns, into one coherent application architecture. This aspect of system-building is often
        overlooked by vendors who claim that their product can satisfy all your needs. In reality,
        integrating disparate systems is one of the most important things that needs to be done in a
        nontrivial application.</p>

        <h1>Systems of Record and Derived Data</h1>
        
        <p>On a high level, systems that store and process data can be grouped into two broad categories:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Systems of record</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="systems of record" id="idm45085102527440"></a>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="source of truth" data-see="systems of record" id="idm45085102526608"></a>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="normalization (data representation)" data-secondary="in systems of record" id="idm45085102525472"></a>
            A system of record, also known as <em>source of truth</em>, holds the authoritative version
            of your data.  When new data comes in, e.g., as user input, it is first written here. Each fact
            is represented exactly once (the representation is typically <em>normalized</em>). If there is
            any discrepancy between another system and the system of record, then the value in the system of
            record is (by definition) the correct one.</p>
            </dd>
        
            <dt>Derived data systems</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="derived data" id="idm45085102521984"></a>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="materialization" data-secondary="materialized views" data-tertiary="as derived data" id="idm45085102521120"></a>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="as derived data" id="idm45085102519744"></a>
            <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="caches" data-secondary="as derived data" id="idm45085102518640"></a>
            Data in a derived system is the result of taking some existing data from another system and
            transforming or processing it in some way. If you lose derived data, you can recreate it from
            the original source. A classic example is a cache: data can be served from the cache if present,
            but if the cache doesn’t contain what you need, you can fall back to the underlying
            database. Denormalized values, indexes, and materialized views also fall into this category. In
            recommendation systems, predictive summary data is often derived from usage logs.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="denormalization (data representation)" data-secondary="in derived data systems" id="idm45085102516304"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="redundancy" data-secondary="of derived data" data-seealso="derived data" id="idm45085102515152"></a>
        Technically speaking, derived data is <em>redundant</em>, in the sense that it duplicates
        existing information. However, it is often essential for getting good performance on read queries.
        It is commonly <em>denormalized</em>. You can derive several different datasets from a single
        source, enabling you to look at the data from different “points of view.”</p>
        
        <p>Not all systems make a clear distinction between systems of record and derived data in their
        architecture, but it’s a very helpful distinction to make, because it clarifies the dataflow
        through your system: it makes explicit which parts of the system have which inputs and which
        outputs, and how they depend on each other.</p>
        
        <p>Most databases, storage engines, and query languages are not inherently either a system of record
        or a derived system. A database is just a tool: how you use it is up to you. The distinction between
        system of record and derived data system depends not on the tool, but on how you use it in your
        application.</p>
        
        <p>By being clear about which data is derived from which other data, you can bring clarity to an
        otherwise confusing system architecture. This point will be a running theme throughout this part of
        the book.</p>

        <h1>Overview of Chapters</h1>
        
        <p>We will start in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> by examining batch-oriented dataflow
        systems such as MapReduce, and see how they give us good tools and principles for building
        large-scale data systems. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#ch_stream">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> we will take those ideas and
        apply them to data streams, which allow us to do the same kinds of things with lower delays.
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#ch_future">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> concludes the book by exploring ideas about how we might
        use these tools to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications in the future.</p>
