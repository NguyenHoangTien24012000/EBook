        So far, this book has been mostly about describing things as they <em>are</em> at present. In this final
        chapter, we will shift our perspective toward the future and discuss how things <em>should be</em>: I will
        propose some ideas and approaches that, I believe, may fundamentally improve the ways we design and
        build applications.</p>
        
        <p>Opinions and speculation about the future are of course subjective, and so I will use the first
        person in this chapter when writing about my personal opinions. You are welcome to disagree with
        them and form your own opinions, but I hope that the ideas in this chapter will at least be a
        starting point for a productive discussion and bring some clarity to concepts that are often
        confused.</p>

        The goal of this book was outlined in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch_introduction">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>: to explore how to create applications and
        systems that are <em>reliable</em>, <em>scalable</em>, and <em>maintainable</em>. These themes have run through all of
        the chapters: for example, we discussed many fault-tolerance algorithms that help improve
        reliability, partitioning to improve scalability, and mechanisms for evolution and abstraction that
        improve maintainability. In this chapter we will bring all of these ideas together, and build on
        them to envisage the future. Our goal is to discover how to design applications that are better than
        the ones of today—robust, correct, evolvable, and ultimately beneficial to humanity.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Integration"><div class="sect1" id="sec_future_integration">
        <h1>Data Integration</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data systems" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="data integration" id="ix_datasysfutdi"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data integration" id="ix_dataint"></a>
        A recurring theme in this book has been that for any given problem, there are several solutions, all
        of which have different pros, cons, and trade-offs. For example, when discussing storage engines in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch_storage">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, we saw log-structured storage, B-trees, and column-oriented storage. When discussing
        replication in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#ch_replication">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, we saw single-leader, multi-leader, and leaderless approaches.</p>
        
        <p>If you have a problem such as “I want to store some data and look it up again later,” there is no
        one right solution, but many different approaches that are each appropriate in different
        circumstances. A software implementation typically has to pick one particular approach. It’s hard
        enough to get one code path robust and performing well—trying to do everything in one piece of
        software almost guarantees that the implementation will be poor.</p>
        
        <p>Thus, the most appropriate choice of software tool also depends on the circumstances. Every piece of
        software, even a so-called “general-purpose” database, is designed for a particular usage pattern.</p>
        
        <p>Faced with this profusion of alternatives, the first challenge is then to figure out the mapping
        between the software products and the circumstances in which they are a good fit. Vendors are
        understandably reluctant to tell you about the kinds of workloads for which their software is poorly
        suited, but hopefully the previous chapters have equipped you with some questions to ask in order to
        read between the lines and better understand the trade-offs.</p>
        
        <p>However, even if you perfectly understand the mapping between tools and circumstances for their use,
        there is another challenge: in complex applications, data is often used in several different ways.
        There is unlikely to be one piece of software that is suitable for <em>all</em> the
        different circumstances in which the data is used, so you inevitably end up having to cobble
        together several different pieces of software in order to provide your application’s functionality.</p>

        <h2>Combining Specialized Tools by Deriving Data</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data integration" data-secondary="combining tools by deriving data" id="ix_dataintcombine"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PostgreSQL (database)" data-secondary="full text search support" id="idm45085099899808"></a>
        For example, it is common to need to integrate an OLTP database with a full-text search index in
        order to handle queries for arbitrary keywords. Although some databases (such as PostgreSQL) include
        a full-text indexing feature, which can be sufficient for simple applications
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Belaid2015tl-marker" href="ch12.html#Belaid2015tl">1</a>], more sophisticated search
        facilities require specialist information retrieval tools. Conversely, search indexes are generally
        not very suitable as a durable system of record, and so many applications need to combine two
        different tools in order to satisfy all of the requirements.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="denormalization (data representation)" data-secondary="updating derived data" id="idm45085099895632"></a>
        We touched on the issue of integrating data systems in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_sync">“Keeping Systems in Sync”</a>. As the number of
        different representations of the data increases, the integration problem becomes harder. Besides the
        database and the search index, perhaps you need to keep copies of the data in analytics systems
        (data warehouses, or batch and stream processing systems); maintain caches or denormalized versions
        of objects that were derived from the original data; pass the data through machine learning,
        classification, ranking, or recommendation systems; or send notifications based on changes to the
        data.</p>
        
        <p>Surprisingly often I see software engineers make statements like, “In my experience, 99% of people
        only need X” or “…don’t need X” (for various values of X). I think that such statements say more
        about the experience of the speaker than about the actual usefulness of a technology. The range of
        different things you might want to do with data is dizzyingly wide. What one person considers to be
        an obscure and pointless feature may well be a central requirement for someone else. The need for
        data integration often only becomes apparent if you zoom out and consider the dataflows across an
        entire organization.</p>

        <h3>Reasoning about dataflows</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data integration" data-secondary="combining tools by deriving data" data-tertiary="reasoning about dataflows" id="idm45085099890608"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dataflow" data-secondary="reasoning about" id="idm45085099889152"></a>
        When copies of the same data need to be maintained in several storage systems in order to satisfy
        different access patterns, you need to be very clear about the inputs and outputs: where is data
        written first, and which representations are derived from which sources? How do you get data into
        all the right places, in the right formats?</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consistency" data-secondary="of secondary indexes" id="idm45085099887440"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="systems of record" data-secondary="change data capture" id="idm45085099886336"></a>
        For example, you might arrange for data to first be written to a system of record database,
        capturing the changes made to that database (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc">“Change Data Capture”</a>) and then applying the changes
        to the search index in the same order. If change data capture (CDC) is the only way of updating the
        index, you can be confident that the index is entirely derived from the system of record, and
        therefore consistent with it (barring bugs in the software). Writing to the database is the only way
        of supplying new input into this system.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="secondary" data-tertiary="problems with dual writes" id="idm45085099883632"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="secondary indexes" data-secondary="problems with dual writes" id="idm45085099882240"></a>
        Allowing the application to directly write to both the search index and the database introduces the
        problem shown in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#fig_stream_write_order">Figure&nbsp;11-4</a>, in which two clients concurrently send conflicting
        writes, and the two storage systems process them in a different order. In this case, neither the
        database nor the search index is “in charge” of determining the order of writes, and so they may
        make contradictory decisions and become permanently inconsistent with each other.</p>
        
        <p>If it is possible for you to funnel all user input through a single system that decides on an
        ordering for all writes, it becomes much easier to derive other representations of the data by
        processing the writes in the same order. This is an application of the state machine replication
        approach that we saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_total_order">“Total Order Broadcast”</a>. Whether you use change data capture or an
        event sourcing log is less important than simply the principle of deciding on a total order.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deterministic operations" data-secondary="and idempotence" id="idm45085099877872"></a>
        Updating a derived data system based on an event log can often be made deterministic and idempotent
        (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence">“Idempotence”</a>), making it quite easy to recover from faults.</p>

        <h3>Derived data versus distributed transactions</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consistency" data-secondary="across different databases" id="idm45085099873984"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data integration" data-secondary="combining tools by deriving data" data-tertiary="derived data versus distributed transactions" id="idm45085099872864"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="transactions" data-secondary="distributed transactions" data-tertiary="avoiding" id="idm45085099870256"></a>
        The classic approach for keeping different data systems consistent with each other involves
        distributed transactions, as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc">“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”</a>. How does the approach of using
        derived data systems fare in comparison to distributed transactions?</p>
        
        <p>At an abstract level, they achieve a similar goal by different means. Distributed transactions
        decide on an ordering of writes by using locks for mutual exclusion (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_2pl">“Two-Phase Locking (2PL)”</a>),
        while CDC and event sourcing use a log for ordering.  Distributed transactions use atomic commit to
        ensure that changes take effect exactly once, while log-based systems are often based on
        deterministic retry and idempotence.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="linearizability" data-secondary="of derived data systems" id="idm45085099865904"></a>
        The biggest difference is that transaction systems usually provide linearizability (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_linearizability">“Linearizability”</a>), which implies useful guarantees such as reading your own
        writes (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_ryw">“Reading Your Own Writes”</a>). On the other hand, derived data systems are often updated
        asynchronously, and so they do not by default offer the same timing guarantees.</p>
        
        <p>Within limited environments that are willing to pay the cost of distributed transactions, they have
        been used successfully. However, I think that XA has poor fault tolerance and performance
        characteristics (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans">“Distributed Transactions in Practice”</a>), which severely limit its usefulness. I believe
        that it might be possible to create a better protocol for distributed transactions, but getting such
        a protocol widely adopted and integrated with existing tools would be challenging, and unlikely to
        happen soon.</p>
        
        <p>In the absence of widespread support for a good distributed transaction protocol, I believe that
        log-based derived data is the most promising approach for integrating different data systems.
        However, guarantees such as reading your own writes are useful, and I don’t think that it is
        productive to tell everyone “eventual consistency is inevitable—suck it up and learn to deal with
        it” (at least not without good guidance on <em>how</em> to deal with it).</p>
        
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_correctness">“Aiming for Correctness”</a> we will discuss some approaches for implementing stronger guarantees
        on top of asynchronously derived systems, and work toward a middle ground between distributed
        transactions and asynchronous log-based systems.</p>

        With systems that are small enough, constructing a totally ordered event log is entirely feasible
        (as demonstrated by the popularity of databases with single-leader replication, which construct
        precisely such a log). However, as systems are scaled toward bigger and more complex workloads,
        limitations begin to emerge:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>In most cases, constructing a totally ordered log requires all events to pass through a <em>single
        leader node</em> that decides on the ordering. If the throughput of events is greater than a single
        machine can handle, you need to partition the log across multiple machines (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_log">“Partitioned Logs”</a>).
        The order of events in two different partitions is then ambiguous.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="coordination" data-secondary="cross-datacenter" id="idm45085099847040"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="datacenters" data-secondary="geographically distributed" id="idm45085099845936"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="geographically distributed datacenters" id="idm45085099844816"></a>
        If the servers are spread across multiple <em>geographically distributed</em> datacenters, for example in
        order to tolerate an entire datacenter going offline, you typically have a separate leader in each
        datacenter, because network delays make synchronous cross-datacenter coordination inefficient (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_multi_leader">“Multi-Leader Replication”</a>). This implies an undefined ordering of events that originate in
        two different datacenters.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="causal dependencies across services" id="idm45085099841664"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="services" data-secondary="microservices" data-tertiary="causal dependencies across services" id="idm45085099840544"></a>
        When applications are deployed as <em>microservices</em> (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_rpc">“Dataflow Through Services: REST and RPC”</a>), a common
        design choice is to deploy each service and its durable state as an independent unit, with no
        durable state shared between services. When two events originate in different services, there is
        no defined order for those events.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Some applications maintain client-side state that is updated immediately on user input (without
        waiting for confirmation from a server), and even continue to work offline (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_offline_clients">“Clients with offline operation”</a>). With such applications, clients and servers are very likely
        to see events in different orders.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" data-secondary="deciding on total order of" id="idm45085099835088"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="total order broadcast" id="idm45085099833968"></a>
        In formal terms, deciding on a total order of events is known as <em>total order broadcast</em>, which is
        equivalent to consensus (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_consensus_abcast">“Consensus algorithms and total order broadcast”</a>). Most consensus algorithms are
        designed for situations in which the throughput of a single node is sufficient to process the entire
        stream of events, and these algorithms do not provide a mechanism for multiple nodes to share the
        work of ordering the events. It is still an open research problem to design consensus algorithms
        that can scale beyond the throughput of a single node and that work well in a geographically
        distributed setting.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" data-secondary="ordering to capture causality" id="idm45085099825760"></a>
        In cases where there is no causal link between events, the lack of a total order is not a big
        problem, since concurrent events can be ordered arbitrarily. Some other cases are easy to handle:
        for example, when there are multiple updates of the same object, they can be totally ordered by
        routing all updates for a particular object ID to the same log partition. However, causal
        dependencies sometimes arise in more subtle ways (see also <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_causality">“Ordering and Causality”</a>).</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="incidents" data-secondary="sending message to ex-partner" id="idm45085099823088"></a>
        For example, consider a social networking service, and two users who were in a relationship but have
        just broken up. One of the users removes the other as a friend, and then sends a message to their
        remaining friends complaining about their ex-partner. The user’s intention is that their ex-partner
        should not see the rude message, since the message was sent after the friend status was revoked.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="causal dependencies" data-secondary="sending message to friends (example)" id="idm45085099821296"></a>
        However, in a system that stores friendship status in one place and messages in another place, that
        ordering dependency between the <em>unfriend</em> event and the <em>message-send</em> event may be lost. If the
        causal dependency is not captured, a service that sends notifications about new messages may process
        the <em>message-send</em> event before the <em>unfriend</em> event, and thus incorrectly send a notification to
        the ex-partner.</p>
        
        <p>In this example, the notifications are effectively a join between the messages and the friend list,
        making it related to the timing issues of joins that we discussed previously (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_join_time">“Time-dependence of joins”</a>). Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a simple answer to this problem

        Logical timestamps can provide total ordering without coordination (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_timestamps">“Sequence Number Ordering”</a>), so they may help in cases where total order broadcast is not
        feasible. However, they still require recipients to handle events that are delivered out of order,
        and they require additional metadata to be passed around.</p>

        <li>
        <p>If you can log an event to record the state of the system that the user saw before making a
        decision, and give that event a unique identifier, then any later events can reference that event
        identifier in order to record the causal dependency

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stream processing" data-secondary="for data integration" id="ix_strmprocfut"></a>
        I would say that the goal of data integration is to make sure that data ends up in the right form in
        all the right places. Doing so requires consuming inputs, transforming, joining, filtering,
        aggregating, training models, evaluating, and eventually writing to the appropriate outputs. Batch
        and stream processors are the tools for achieving this goal.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="derived data" data-secondary="outputs of batch and stream processing" id="idm45085099791824"></a>
        The outputs of batch and stream processes are derived datasets such as search indexes, materialized
        views, recommendations to show to users, aggregate metrics, and so on (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_output">“The Output of Batch Workflows”</a> and

        <p>As we saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#ch_stream">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>, batch and stream processing have a lot of principles in
        common, and the main fundamental difference is that stream processors operate on unbounded datasets
        whereas batch process inputs are of a known, finite size. There are also many detailed differences
        in the ways the processing engines are implemented, but these distinctions are beginning to blur.</p>

        In principle, one type of processing can be emulated on top of the other, although the performance

        Batch processing has a quite strong functional flavor (even if the code is not written in a
        functional programming language): it encourages deterministic, pure functions whose output depends
        only on the input and which have no side effects other than the explicit outputs, treating inputs as
        immutable and outputs as append-only. Stream processing is similar, but it extends operators to
        allow managed, fault-tolerant state (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_state_fault_tolerance">“Rebuilding state after a failure”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>The principle of deterministic functions with well-defined inputs and outputs is not only good for
        fault tolerance (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence">“Idempotence”</a>), but also simplifies reasoning about the dataflows
        in an organization [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kreps2013vs_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Kreps2013vs_ch12">7</a>]. No matter whether the derived data
        is a search index, a statistical model, or a cache, it is helpful to think in terms of data
        pipelines that derive one thing from another, pushing state changes in one system through functional
        application code and applying the effects to derived systems.</p>

        In principle, derived data systems could be maintained synchronously, just like a relational
        database updates secondary indexes synchronously within the same transaction as writes to the table
        being indexed. However, asynchrony is what makes systems based on event logs robust: it allows a
        fault in one part of the system to be contained locally, whereas distributed transactions abort if
        any one participant fails, so they tend to amplify failures by spreading them to the rest of the
        system (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_trans_limits">“Limitations of distributed transactions”</a>).</p>

        We saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#sec_partitioning_secondary_indexes">“Partitioning and Secondary Indexes”</a> that secondary indexes often cross partition
        boundaries. A partitioned system with secondary indexes either needs to send writes to multiple
        partitions (if the index is term-partitioned) or send reads to all partitions (if the index is
        document-partitioned). Such cross-partition communication is also most reliable and scalable if the
        index is maintained asynchronously [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Helland2007td_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Helland2007td_ch12">8</a>]

        When maintaining derived data, batch and stream processing are both useful. Stream processing allows
        changes in the input to be reflected in derived views with low delay, whereas batch processing
        allows large amounts of accumulated historical data to be reprocessed in order to derive new views
        onto an existing dataset.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="schemas" data-secondary="evolution of" id="idm45085099741920"></a>
        In particular, reprocessing existing data provides a good mechanism for maintaining a system,
        evolving it to support new features and changed requirements (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch_encoding">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>). Without
        reprocessing, schema evolution is limited to simple changes like adding a new optional field to a
        record, or adding a new type of record. This is the case both in a schema-on-write and in a
        schema-on-read context (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#sec_datamodels_schema_flexibility">“Schema flexibility in the document model”</a>). On the other hand, with
        reprocessing it is possible to restructure a dataset into a completely different model in order to
        better serve new requirements.</p>

        <h5>Schema Migrations on Railways</h5>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="railways, schema migration on" id="idm45085099735728"></a>
        Large-scale “schema migrations” occur in noncomputer systems as well. For example, in the early
        days of railway building in 19th-century England there were various competing standards for the
        gauge (the distance between the two rails). Trains built for one gauge couldn’t run on tracks of
        another gauge, which restricted the possible interconnections in the train network
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="NetworkRail-marker" href="ch12.html#NetworkRail">9</a>].</p>
        
        <p>After a single standard gauge was finally decided upon in 1846, tracks with other gauges had to be
        converted—but how do you do this without shutting down the train line for months or years? The
        solution is to first convert the track to <em>dual gauge</em> or <em>mixed gauge</em> by adding a third rail. This
        conversion can be done gradually, and when it is done, trains of both gauges can run on the line,
        using two of the three rails. Eventually, once all trains have been converted to the standard gauge, the
        rail providing the nonstandard gauge can be removed.</p>
        
        <p>“Reprocessing” the existing tracks in this way, and allowing the old and new versions to exist side by side,
        makes it possible to change the gauge gradually over the course of years. Nevertheless, it is an
        expensive undertaking, which is why nonstandard gauges still exist today. For example, the BART
        system in the San Francisco Bay Area uses a different gauge from the majority of the US.</p>

        Derived views allow <em>gradual</em> evolution. If you want to restructure a dataset, you do not
        need to perform the migration as a sudden switch. Instead, you can maintain the old schema and the
        new schema side by side as two independently derived views onto the same underlying data. You can
        then start shifting a small number of users to the new view in order to test its performance and
        find any bugs, while most users continue to be routed to the old view. Gradually, you can increase
        the proportion of users accessing the new view, and eventually you can drop the old view

        The beauty of such a gradual migration is that every stage of the process is easily reversible if
        something goes wrong: you always have a working system to go back to. By reducing the risk of
        irreversible damage, you can be more confident about going ahead, and thus move faster to improve

        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_event_sourcing">“Event Sourcing”</a>). From these events, read-optimized views are derived. The lambda
        architecture proposes running two different systems in parallel: a batch processing system such as
        Hadoop MapReduce, and a separate stream-processing system such as Storm.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="correctness" data-secondary="of derived data" id="idm45085099708256"></a>
        In the lambda approach, the stream processor consumes the events and quickly produces an approximate
        update to the view; the batch processor later consumes the <em>same</em> set of events and produces a
        corrected version of the derived view. The reasoning behind this design is that batch processing is
        simpler and thus less prone to bugs, while stream processors are thought to be less reliable and
        harder to make fault-tolerant (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance">“Fault Tolerance”</a>). Moreover, the stream process can
        use fast approximate algorithms while the batch process uses slower exact algorithms.</p>
        
        <p>The lambda architecture was an influential idea that shaped the design of data systems for the
        better, particularly by popularizing the principle of deriving views onto streams of immutable
        events and reprocessing events when needed. However, I also think that the lambda architecture
        has a number of practical problems:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Twitter" data-secondary="Summingbird (processing library)" id="idm45085099703584"></a>
        Having to maintain the same logic to run both in a batch and in a stream processing framework is
        significant additional effort. Although libraries such as Summingbird
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Boykin2014vf-marker" href="ch12.html#Boykin2014vf">13</a>] provide an abstraction for
        computations that can be run in either a batch or a streaming context, the operational complexity
        of debugging, tuning, and maintaining two different systems remains
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kreps2014wv_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Kreps2014wv_ch12">14</a>].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Since the stream pipeline and the batch pipeline produce separate outputs, they need to be merged
        in order to respond to user requests. This merge is fairly easy if the computation is a simple
        aggregation over a tumbling window, but it becomes significantly harder if the view is derived
        using more complex operations such as joins and sessionization, or if the output is not a time
        series.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="straggler events" id="idm45085099695408"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" data-secondary="stragglers" id="idm45085099694704"></a>
        Although it is great to have the ability to reprocess the entire historical dataset, doing so
        frequently is expensive on large datasets. Thus, the batch pipeline often needs to be set up to
        process incremental batches (e.g., an hour’s worth of data at the end of every hour) rather than
        reprocessing everything. This raises the problems discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_time">“Reasoning About Time”</a>, such as
        handling stragglers and handling windows that cross boundaries between batches. Incrementalizing
        a batch computation adds complexity, making it more akin to the streaming layer, which runs
        counter to the goal of keeping the batch layer as simple as possible.</p>

        More recent work has enabled the benefits of the lambda architecture to be enjoyed without its
        downsides, by allowing both batch computations (reprocessing historical data) and stream
        computations (processing events as they arrive) to be implemented in the same system
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="CastroFernandez2015uz-marker" href="ch12.html#CastroFernandez2015uz">15</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Unifying batch and stream processing in one system requires the following features, which are
        becoming increasingly widely available:</p>

        The ability to replay historical events through the same processing engine that handles the stream
        of recent events. For example, log-based message brokers have the ability to replay messages (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_replay">“Replaying old messages”</a>), and some stream processors can read input from a distributed filesystem
        like HDFS.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exactly-once semantics" data-secondary="parity with batch processors" id="idm45085099675904"></a>
        Exactly-once semantics for stream processors—that is, ensuring that the output is the same as
        if no faults had occurred, even if faults did in fact occur (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance">“Fault Tolerance”</a>).
        Like with batch processing, this requires discarding the partial output of any failed tasks.</p>

          an API for expressing such computations, which can then be run using Apache Flink or Google Cloud
          Dataflow.

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Unix philosophy" data-secondary="relation to Hadoop" id="idm45085099645936"></a>
        At a most abstract level, databases, Hadoop, and operating systems all perform the same functions:
        they store some data, and they allow you to process and query that data
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Ritchie1974gg-marker" href="ch12.html#Ritchie1974gg">16</a>].
        A database stores data in records of some data model (rows in tables, documents, vertices in a
        graph, etc.) while an operating system’s filesystem stores data in files—but at their core, both
        are “information management” systems
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Brewer2011uh-marker" href="ch12.html#Brewer2011uh">17</a>]. As we saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>, the Hadoop ecosystem is somewhat like a
        distributed version of Unix.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, there are many practical differences. For example, many filesystems do not cope very well
        with a directory containing 10 million small files, whereas a database containing 10 million small
        records is completely normal and unremarkable. Nevertheless, the similarities and differences
        between operating systems and databases are worth exploring.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="relational databases" data-secondary="philosophy compared to Unix" id="idm45085099637680"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Unix philosophy" data-secondary="comparison to relational databases" id="idm45085099636512"></a>
        Unix and relational databases have approached the information management problem with very different
        philosophies. Unix viewed its purpose as presenting programmers with a logical but fairly low-level
        hardware abstraction, whereas relational databases wanted to give application programmers a
        high-level abstraction that would hide the complexities of data structures on disk, concurrency,
        crash recovery, and so on. Unix developed pipes and files that are just sequences of bytes, whereas
        databases developed SQL and transactions.</p>
        
        <p>Which approach is better? Of course, it depends what you want. Unix is “simpler” in the sense that
        it is a fairly thin wrapper around hardware resources; relational databases are “simpler” in the
        sense that a short declarative query can draw on a lot of powerful infrastructure (query
        optimization, indexes, join methods, concurrency control, replication, etc.) without the author of
        the query needing to understand the implementation details.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="NoSQL" id="idm45085099633712"></a>
        The tension between these philosophies has lasted for decades (both Unix and the relational model
        emerged in the early 1970s) and still isn’t resolved. For example, I would interpret the NoSQL
        movement as wanting to apply a Unix-esque approach of low-level abstractions to the domain of
        distributed OLTP data storage.</p>
        
        <p>In this section I will attempt to reconcile the two philosophies, in the hope that we can combine
        the best of both worlds.</p>

        work, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Secondary indexes, which allow you to efficiently search for records based on the value of a field
        (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_other_indexing">“Other Indexing Structures”</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Materialized views, which are a kind of precomputed cache of query results (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_materialized_views">“Aggregation: Data Cubes and Materialized Views”</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Replication logs, which keep copies of the data on other nodes up to date (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_implementation">“Implementation of Replication Logs”</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Full-text search indexes, which allow keyword search in text (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_full_text">“Full-text search and fuzzy indexes”</a>) and
        which are built into some relational databases
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Belaid2015tl">1</a>]</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch10.html#ch_batch">10</a>
        and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch11.html#ch_stream">11</a>,
        similar themes emerged. We talked about building full-text search indexes (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_output">“The Output of Batch Workflows”</a>), about materialized view maintenance (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_mat_view">“Maintaining materialized views”</a>), and about
        replicating changes from a database to derived data systems (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc">“Change Data Capture”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>It seems that there are parallels between the features that are built into databases and the
        derived data systems that people are building with batch and stream processors.</p>

        <h3>Creating an index</h3>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="snapshots (databases)" data-secondary="computing derived data" id="idm45085099601040"></a>
        Think about what happens when you run <code>CREATE INDEX</code> to create a new index in a relational database.
        The database has to scan over a consistent snapshot of a table, pick out all of the field values
        being indexed, sort them, and write out the index. Then it must process the backlog of writes that
        have been made since the consistent snapshot was taken (assuming the table was not locked while
        creating the index, so writes could continue). Once that is done, the database must continue to keep
        the index up to date whenever a transaction writes to the table.</p>
        
        <p>This process is remarkably similar to setting up a new follower replica (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_new_replica">“Setting Up New Followers”</a>), and also very similar to bootstrapping change data capture in a
        streaming system (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc_snapshot">“Initial snapshot”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>Whenever you run <code>CREATE INDEX</code>, the database essentially reprocesses the existing dataset (as
        discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_reprocessing">“Reprocessing data for application evolution”</a>) and derives the index as a new view onto the existing
        data. The existing data may be a snapshot of the state rather than a log of all changes that ever
        happened, but the two are closely related (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability">“State, Streams, and Immutability”</a>).</p>

        <h3>The meta-database of everything</h3>
        
        <p>In this light, I think that the dataflow across an entire organization starts looking like one huge
        database [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Kreps2013vs_ch12">7</a>]. Whenever a batch, stream,
        or ETL process transports data from one place and form to another place and form, it is acting like
        the database subsystem that keeps indexes or materialized views up to date.</p>
        
        <p>Viewed like this, batch and stream processors are like elaborate implementations of triggers, stored
        procedures, and materialized view maintenance routines. The derived data systems they maintain are
        like different index types. For example, a relational database may support B-tree indexes, hash
        indexes, spatial indexes (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#sec_storage_index_multicolumn">“Multi-column indexes”</a>), and other types of indexes. In the
        emerging architecture of derived data systems, instead of implementing those facilities as features
        of a single integrated database product, they are provided by various different pieces of software,
        running on different machines, administered by different teams.</p>

        Where will these developments take us in the future? If we start from the premise that there is no
        single data model or storage format that is suitable for all access patterns, I speculate that there
        are two avenues by which different storage and processing tools can nevertheless be composed into a
        cohesive system:</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PostgreSQL (database)" data-secondary="foreign data wrappers" id="idm45085099582832"></a>
        It is possible to provide a unified query interface to a wide variety of underlying storage
        engines and processing methods—an approach known as a <em>federated database</em> or <em>polystore</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Stonebraker2015wu-marker" href="ch12.html#Stonebraker2015wu">18</a>, <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Duggan2015de-marker" href="ch12.html#Duggan2015de">19</a>].
        For example, PostgreSQL’s <em>foreign data wrapper</em> feature fits this pattern
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Dybka2015bn-marker" href="ch12.html#Dybka2015bn">20</a>].
        Applications that need a specialized data model or query interface can still access the underlying
        storage engines directly, while users who want to combine data from disparate places can do so
        easily through the federated interface.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="relational databases" data-secondary="philosophy compared to Unix" id="idm45085099572320"></a>
        A federated query interface follows the relational tradition of a single integrated system with a
        high-level query language and elegant semantics, but a complicated implementation.</p>

        <dd>
        <p>While federation addresses read-only querying across several different systems, it does not have a
        good answer to synchronizing writes across those systems. We said that within a single database,
        creating a consistent index is a built-in feature. When we compose several storage systems, we
        similarly need to ensure that all data changes end up in all the right places, even in the face of
        faults. Making it easier to reliably plug together storage systems (e.g., through change data
        capture and event logs) is like <em>unbundling</em> a database’s index-maintenance features in a way that
        can synchronize writes across disparate technologies

        <h3>Making unbundling work</h3>
        
        <p>Federation and unbundling are two sides of the same coin: composing a reliable, scalable, and
        maintainable system out of diverse components. Federated read-only querying requires mapping one
        data model into another, which takes some thought but is ultimately quite a manageable problem. I
        think that keeping the writes to several storage systems in sync is the harder engineering problem,
        and so I will focus <span class="keep-together">on it.</span></p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="transactions" data-secondary="distributed transactions" data-tertiary="avoiding" id="idm45085099557232"></a>
        The traditional approach to synchronizing writes requires distributed transactions across
        heterogeneous storage systems [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Stonebraker2015wu">18</a>], which
        I think is the wrong solution (see <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_derived_vs_transactions">“Derived data versus distributed transactions”</a>). Transactions within a
        single storage or stream processing system are feasible, but when data crosses the boundary between
        different technologies, I believe that an asynchronous event log with idempotent writes is a much
        more robust and practicable approach.</p>
        
        <p>For example, distributed transactions are used within some stream processors to achieve exactly-once
        semantics (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_atomic_commit">“Atomic commit revisited”</a>), and this can work quite well. However, when a
        transaction would need to involve systems written by different groups of people (e.g., when data is
        written from a stream processor to a distributed key-value store or search index), the lack of a
        standardized transaction protocol makes integration much harder. An ordered log of events with
        idempotent consumers (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence">“Idempotence”</a>) is a much simpler abstraction, and thus much
        more feasible to implement across heterogeneous systems
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Kreps2013vs_ch12">7</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="loose coupling" id="idm45085099549984"></a>
        The big advantage of log-based integration is <em>loose coupling</em> between the various components, which
        manifests itself in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consumers (message streams)" data-secondary="not keeping up with producers" id="idm45085099547696"></a>
        At a system level, asynchronous event streams make the system as a whole more robust to outages
        or performance degradation of individual components. If a consumer runs slow or fails, the event
        log can buffer messages (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_disk_usage">“Disk space usage”</a>), allowing the producer and any other
        consumers to continue running unaffected. The faulty consumer can catch up when it is fixed, so
        it doesn’t miss any data, and the fault is contained. By contrast, the synchronous interaction of
        distributed transactions tends to escalate local faults into large-scale failures (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_trans_limits">“Limitations of distributed transactions”</a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="services" data-secondary="microservices" data-tertiary="loose coupling" id="idm45085099542528"></a>
        At a human level, unbundling data systems allows different software components and services to be
        developed, improved, and maintained independently from each other by different teams.
        Specialization allows each team to focus on doing one thing well, with well-defined interfaces to
        other teams’ systems. Event logs provide an interface that is powerful enough to capture fairly
        strong consistency properties (due to durability and ordering of events), but also general enough
        to be applicable to almost any kind of data.</p>

        <h3>Unbundled versus integrated systems</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="massively parallel processing (MPP)" data-secondary="comparison to composing storage technologies" id="idm45085099538944"></a>
        If unbundling does indeed become the way of the future, it will not replace databases in their
        current form—they will still be needed as much as ever. Databases are still required for
        maintaining state in stream processors, and in order to serve queries for the output of batch and
        stream processors (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_output">“The Output of Batch Workflows”</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_processing">“Processing Streams”</a>). Specialized query
        engines will continue to be important for particular workloads: for example, query engines in MPP
        data warehouses are optimized for exploratory analytic queries and handle this kind of workload
        very well (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_mr_vs_db">“Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>The complexity of running several different pieces of infrastructure can be a problem: each piece of
        software has a learning curve, configuration issues, and operational quirks, and so it is worth
        deploying as few moving parts as possible. A single integrated software product may also be able to
        achieve better and more predictable performance on the kinds of workloads for which it is designed,
        compared to a system consisting of several tools that you have composed with application code
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Hugg2016tq-marker" href="ch12.html#Hugg2016tq">23</a>].
        As I said in the <a data-type="xref" href="preface01.html#preface">Preface</a>, building for scale that you don’t need is wasted effort and may lock you
        into an inflexible design. In effect, it is a form of premature optimization.</p>
        
        <p>The goal of unbundling is not to compete with individual databases on performance for particular
        workloads; the goal is to allow you to combine several different databases in order to achieve good
        performance for a much wider range of workloads than is possible with a single piece of software. It’s
        about breadth, not depth—in the same vein as the diversity of storage and processing models that
        we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_mr_vs_db">“Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Thus, if there is a single technology that does everything you need, you’re most likely best off
        simply using that product rather than trying to reimplement it yourself from lower-level components.
        The advantages of unbundling and composition only come into the picture when there is no single
        piece of software that satisfies all your requirements.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="unbundling databases" data-secondary="composing data storage technologies" data-tertiary="need for high-level language" id="idm45085099526048"></a>
        The tools for composing data systems are getting better, but I think one major part is missing: we
        don’t yet have the unbundled-database equivalent of the Unix shell (i.e., a high-level language for
        composing storage and processing systems in a simple and declarative way).</p>
        
        <p>For example, I would love it if we could simply declare <code>mysql | elasticsearch</code>, by analogy to Unix
        pipes [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Kleppmann2015tz_ch12">22</a>], which would be the
        unbundled equivalent of <code>CREATE INDEX</code>: it would take all the documents in a MySQL database and
        index them in an Elasticsearch cluster. It would then continually capture all the changes made to
        the database and automatically apply them to the search index, without us having to write custom
        application code. This kind of integration should be possible with almost any kind of storage or
        indexing system.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="differential dataflow" id="idm45085099521648"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dataflow" data-secondary="differential" id="idm45085099520480"></a>
        Similarly, it would be great to be able to precompute and update caches more easily. Recall that a
        materialized view is essentially a precomputed cache, so you could imagine creating a cache by
        declaratively specifying materialized views for complex queries, including recursive queries on
        graphs (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#sec_datamodels_graph">“Graph-Like Data Models”</a>) and application logic. There is interesting early-stage
        research in this area, such as <em>differential dataflow</em>

        and I hope that these ideas will find their way into production systems.

        The approach of unbundling databases by composing specialized storage and processing systems with
        application code is also becoming known as the “database inside-out” approach
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Shapira2016ej-marker" href="ch12.html#Shapira2016ej">26</a>], after the title of a conference talk I

        However, calling it a “new architecture” is too grandiose. I see it more as a design pattern, a
        starting point for discussion, and we give it a name simply so that we can better talk about it.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="spreadsheets, dataflow programming capabilities" id="idm45085099489392"></a>
        Even spreadsheets have dataflow programming capabilities that are miles ahead of most mainstream
        programming languages [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Hermans2015ws-marker" href="ch12.html#Hermans2015ws">33</a>]. In a spreadsheet, you can put a formula in one cell (for example, the sum of cells
        in another column), and whenever any input to the formula changes, the result of the formula is
        automatically recalculated. This is exactly what we want at a data system level: when a record in a
        database changes, we want any index for that record to be automatically updated, and any cached
        views or aggregations that depend on the record to be automatically refreshed. You should not have
        to worry about the technical details of how this refresh happens, but be able to simply trust that
        it works correctly.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="VisiCalc (spreadsheets)" id="idm45085099460192"></a>
        Thus, I think that most data systems still have something to learn from the features that VisiCalc
        already had in 1979 [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="BricklinVisiCalc-marker" href="ch12.html#BricklinVisiCalc">34</a>]. The difference from spreadsheets is that today’s
        data systems need to be fault-tolerant, scalable, and store data durably. They also need to be able
        to integrate disparate technologies written by different groups of people over time, and reuse
        existing libraries and services: it is unrealistic to expect all software to be developed using one

        When one dataset is derived from another, it goes through some kind of transformation function. For
        example:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>A secondary index is a kind of derived dataset with a straightforward transformation function: for
        each row or document in the base table, it picks out the values in the columns or fields being
        indexed, and sorts by those values (assuming a B-tree or SSTable index, which are sorted by key,
        as discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch_storage">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>A full-text search index is created by applying various natural language processing functions such
        as language detection, word segmentation, stemming or lemmatization, spelling correction, and
        synonym identification, followed by building a data structure for efficient lookups (such as an
        inverted index).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="machine learning" data-secondary="models derived from training data" id="idm45085099448992"></a>
        In a machine learning system, we can consider the model as being derived from the training data by
        applying various feature extraction and statistical analysis functions. When the model is applied
        to new input data, the output of the model is derived from the input and the model (and hence,
        indirectly, from the training data).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>A cache often contains an aggregation of data in the form in which it is going to be displayed in
        a user interface (UI). Populating the cache thus requires knowledge of what fields are referenced
        in the UI; changes in the UI may require updating the definition of how the cache is populated and
        rebuilding the cache.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The derivation function for a secondary index is so commonly required that it is built into many
        databases as a core feature, and you can invoke it by merely saying <code>CREATE INDEX</code>. For full-text
        indexing, basic linguistic features for common languages may be built into a database, but the more
        sophisticated features often require domain-specific tuning. In machine learning, feature
        engineering is notoriously application-specific, and often has to incorporate detailed knowledge
        about the user interaction and deployment of an application
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Sculley2014un-marker" href="ch12.html#Sculley2014un">35</a>].</p>

        When the function that creates a derived dataset is not a standard cookie-cutter function like
        creating a secondary index, custom code is required to handle the application-specific aspects. And
        this custom code is where many databases struggle. Although relational databases commonly support
        triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions, which can be used to execute application
        code within the database, they have been somewhat of an afterthought in database design (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_transmit">“Transmitting Event Streams”</a>).</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="package managers" id="idm45085099437056"></a>
        In theory, databases could be deployment environments for arbitrary application code, like an
        operating system. However, in practice they have turned out to be poorly suited for this purpose.
        They do not fit well with the requirements of modern application development, such as dependency and
        package management, version control, rolling upgrades, evolvability, monitoring, metrics, calls to
        network services, and integration with external systems.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mesos (cluster manager)" id="idm45085099435504"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="YARN (job scheduler)" id="idm45085099434672"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Docker (container manager)" id="idm45085099433840"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes (cluster manager)" id="idm45085099432992"></a>
        On the other hand, deployment and cluster management tools such as Mesos, YARN, Docker, Kubernetes,
        and others are designed specifically for the purpose of running application code. By focusing on
        doing one thing well, they are able to do it much better than a database that provides execution of
        user-defined functions as one of its many features.</p>
        
        <p>I think it makes sense to have some parts of a system that specialize in durable data storage, and
        other parts that specialize in running application code. The two can interact while still remaining
        independent.</p>
        
        <p>Most web applications today are deployed as stateless services, in which any user request can be
        routed to any application server, and the server forgets everything about the request once it has
        sent the response. This style of deployment is convenient, as servers can be added or removed at
        will, but the state has to go somewhere: typically, a database. The trend has been to keep stateless
        application logic separate from state management (databases): not putting application logic in the
        database and not putting persistent state in the application
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Bailis2015dn-marker" href="ch12.html#Bailis2015dn">36</a>]. As
        people in the functional programming community like to joke, “We believe in the separation of Church
        and state” [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Steele2001ts-marker" href="ch12.html#Steele2001ts">37</a>].<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085099424448-marker" href="ch12.html#idm45085099424448">i</a></sup></p>
        
        <p>In this typical web application model, the database acts as a kind of mutable shared variable that
        can be accessed synchronously over the network. The application can read and update the variable,
        and the database takes care of making it durable, providing some concurrency control and fault
        tolerance.</p>
        
        <p>However, in most programming languages you cannot subscribe to changes in a mutable variable—you can
        only read it periodically. Unlike in a spreadsheet, readers of the variable don’t get notified if
        the value of the variable changes. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="observer pattern" id="idm45085099421328"></a> (You can implement such notifications in
        your own code—this is known as the <em>observer pattern</em>—but most languages do not have this pattern as
        a built-in feature.)</p>

        Databases have inherited this passive approach to mutable data: if you want to find out whether the
        content of the database has changed, often your only option is to poll (i.e., to repeat your query
        periodically). Subscribing to changes is only just beginning to emerge as a feature (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_change_api">“API support for change streams”</a>).</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="state" data-secondary="interplay between state changes and application code" id="idm45085099415632"></a>
        Thinking about applications in terms of dataflow implies renegotiating the relationship between
        application code and state management. Instead of treating a database as a passive variable that is
        manipulated by the application, we think much more about the interplay and collaboration between
        state, state changes, and code that processes them. Application code responds to state changes in
        one place by triggering state changes in another place.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tuple spaces (programming model)" id="idm45085099413776"></a>
        We saw this line of thinking in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_databases">“Databases and Streams”</a>, where we discussed treating the log of
        changes to a database as a stream of events that we can subscribe to. Message-passing systems such
        as actors (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_msg">“Message-Passing Dataflow”</a>) also have this concept of responding to events.
        Already in the 1980s, the <em>tuple spaces</em> model explored expressing distributed computations in terms
        of processes that observe state changes and react to them
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Gelernter1985df-marker" href="ch12.html#Gelernter1985df">38</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Eugster2003ih_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Eugster2003ih_ch12">39</a>].</p>
        
        <p>As discussed, similar things happen inside a database when a trigger fires due to a data change, or
        when a secondary index is updated to reflect a change in the table being indexed. Unbundling the
        database means taking this idea and applying it to the creation of derived datasets outside of the
        primary database: caches, full-text search indexes, machine learning, or analytics systems. We can
        use stream processing and messaging systems for this purpose.</p>
        
        <p>The important thing to keep in mind is that maintaining derived data is not the same as asynchronous
        job execution, for which messaging systems are traditionally designed (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_logs_vs_messaging">“Logs compared to traditional messaging”</a>):</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dual writes, problems with" id="idm45085099401408"></a>
        When maintaining derived data, the order of state changes is often important (if several views are
        derived from an event log, they need to process the events in the same order so that they remain
        consistent with each other).  As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_reordering">“Acknowledgments and redelivery”</a>, many message brokers do
        not have this property when redelivering unacknowledged messages. Dual writes are also ruled out
        (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_sync">“Keeping Systems in Sync”</a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Fault tolerance is essential for derived data: losing just a single message causes the derived dataset
        to go permanently out of sync with its data source. Both message delivery and derived state
        updates must be reliable. For example, many actor systems by default maintain actor state and
        messages in memory, so they are lost if the machine running the actor crashes. Thus, such actor
        systems are unsuitable for maintaining derived data.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="concurrency" data-secondary="reducing, through event logs" id="idm45085099396704"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="race conditions" data-secondary="preventing with event logs" id="idm45085099395584"></a>
        Stable message ordering and fault-tolerant message processing are quite stringent demands, but they
        are much less expensive and more operationally robust than distributed transactions. Modern stream
        processors can provide these ordering and reliability guarantees at scale, and they allow
        application code to be run as stream operators.</p>
        
        <p>This application code can do the arbitrary processing that built-in derivation functions in
        databases generally don’t provide. Like Unix tools chained by pipes, stream operators can be
        composed to build large systems around dataflow. Each operator takes streams of state changes as
        input, and produces other streams of state changes as output.</p>

        The currently trendy style of application development involves breaking down functionality into a
        set of <em>services</em> that communicate via synchronous network requests such as REST APIs (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_rpc">“Dataflow Through Services: REST and RPC”</a>). The advantage of such a service-oriented architecture over a single
        monolithic application is primarily organizational scalability through loose coupling: different
        teams can work on different services, which reduces coordination effort between teams (as long as
        the services can be deployed and updated independently).</p>
        
        <p>Composing stream operators into dataflow systems has a lot of similar characteristics to the
        microservices approach [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Stopford2016tk-marker" href="ch12.html#Stopford2016tk">40</a>]. However, the underlying communication
        mechanism is very different: one-directional, asynchronous message streams rather than synchronous
        request/response interactions.</p>
        
        <p>Besides the advantages listed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_msg">“Message-Passing Dataflow”</a>, such as better fault tolerance,
        dataflow systems can also achieve better performance. For example, say a customer is purchasing an
        item that is priced in one currency but paid for in another currency. In order to perform the
        currency conversion, you need to know the current exchange rate. This operation could be implemented
        in two ways [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Stopford2016tk">40</a>,
        <a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Posta2016uo-marker" href="ch12.html#Posta2016uo">41</a>]:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>In the microservices approach, the code that processes the purchase would probably query an
        exchange-rate service or database in order to obtain the current rate for a particular currency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="locality (data access)" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085099377072"></a>
        In the dataflow approach, the code that processes purchases would subscribe to a stream of
        exchange rate updates ahead of time, and record the current rate in a local database whenever it
        changes. When it comes to processing the purchase, it only needs to query the local database.</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>The second approach has replaced a synchronous network request to another service with a query to a
        local database (which may be on the same machine, even in the same
        process).<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085099374832-marker" href="ch12.html#idm45085099374832">ii</a></sup> Not only is the dataflow approach faster, but it is also more
        robust to the failure of another service. The fastest and most reliable network request is no
        network request at all! Instead of RPC, we now have a stream join between purchase events and
        exchange rate update events (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_table_joins">“Stream-table join (stream enrichment)”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>The join is time-dependent: if the purchase events are reprocessed at a later point in time, the
        exchange rate will have changed. If you want to reconstruct the original output, you will need to
        obtain the historical exchange rate at the original time of purchase. No matter whether you query a
        service or subscribe to a stream of exchange rate updates, you will need to handle this time
        dependence (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_join_time">“Time-dependence of joins”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>Subscribing to a stream of changes, rather than querying the current state when needed, brings us
        closer to a spreadsheet-like model of computation: when some piece of data changes, any derived data
        that depends on it can swiftly be updated. There are still many open questions, for example around
        issues like time-dependent joins, but I believe that building applications around dataflow ideas is
        a very promising direction to go in.

        At an abstract level, the dataflow systems discussed in the last section give you a process for
        creating derived datasets (such as search indexes, materialized views, and predictive models) and
        keeping them up to date. Let’s call that process the <em>write path</em>: whenever some piece of
        information is written to the system, it may go through multiple stages of batch and stream
        processing, and eventually every derived dataset is updated to incorporate the data that was
        written. <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_write_read_paths">Figure&nbsp;12-1</a> shows an example of updating a search index.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="fig_future_write_read_paths" class="figure">

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="read path (derived data)" id="idm45085099354784"></a>
        But why do you create the derived dataset in the first place? Most likely because you want to query
        it again at a later time. This is the <em>read path</em>: when serving a user request you read from the
        derived dataset, perhaps perform some more processing on the results, and construct the response to
        the user.</p>
        
        <p>Taken together, the write path and the read path encompass the whole journey of the data, from the
        point where it is collected to the point where it is consumed (probably by another human). The write
        path is the portion of the journey that is precomputed—i.e., that is done eagerly as soon as the
        data comes in, regardless of whether anyone has asked to see it. The read path is the portion of the
        journey that only happens when someone asks for it. If you are familiar with functional programming
        languages, you might notice that the write path is similar to eager evaluation, and the read path is
        similar to lazy evaluation.</p>
        
        <p>The derived dataset is the place where the write path and the read path meet, as illustrated in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_write_read_paths">Figure&nbsp;12-1</a>. It represents a trade-off between the amount of work that needs to
        be done at write time and the amount that needs to be done at read time.</p>

        A full-text search index is a good example: the write path updates the index, and the read path
        searches the index for keywords. Both reads and writes need to do some work. Writes need to update
        the index entries for all terms that appear in the document. Reads need to search for each of the
        words in the query, and apply Boolean logic to find documents that contain <em>all</em> of the words in the
        query (an <code>AND</code> operator), or <em>any</em> synonym of each of the words (an <code>OR</code> operator).</p>
        
        <p>If you didn’t have an index, a search query would have to scan over all documents (like <code>grep</code>),
        which would get very expensive if you had a large number of documents. No index means less work on
        the write path (no index to update), but a lot more work on the read path.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, you could imagine precomputing the search results for all possible queries. In
        that case, you would have less work to do on the read path: no Boolean logic, just find the results
        for your query and return them. However, the write path would be a lot more expensive: the set of
        possible search queries that could be asked is infinite, and thus precomputing all possible search
        results would require infinite time and storage space. That wouldn’t work so
        well.<sup xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45085099343568-marker" href="ch12.html#idm45085099343568">iii</a></sup></p>
        
        <p>Another option would be to precompute the search results for only a fixed set of the most common
        queries, so that they can be served quickly without having to go to the index. The uncommon queries
        can still be served from the index. This would generally be called a <em>cache</em> of common queries,
        although we could also call it a materialized view, as it would need to be updated when new
        documents appear that should be included in the results of one of the common queries.</p>
        
        <p>From this example we can see that an index is not the only possible boundary between the write path
        and the read path. Caching of common search results is possible, and <code>grep</code>-like scanning without
        the index is also possible on a small number of documents. Viewed like this, the role of caches,
        indexes, and materialized views is simple: they shift the boundary between the read path and the
        write path.  They allow us to do more work on the write path, by precomputing results, in order to
        save effort on the read path.</p>

        <h3>Stateful, offline-capable clients</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="clients" data-secondary="stateful and offline-capable" id="idm45085099335744"></a>

        I find the idea of a boundary between write and read paths interesting because we can discuss
        shifting that boundary and explore what that shift means in practical terms. Let’s look at the idea
        in a different context.</p>
        
        <p>The huge popularity of web applications in the last two decades has led us to certain assumptions
        about application development that are easy to take for granted. In particular, the client/server
        model—in which clients are largely stateless and servers have the authority over data—is so
        common that we almost forget that anything else exists. However, technology keeps moving on, and I
        think it is important to question the status quo from time to time.</p>
        
        <p>Traditionally, web browsers have been stateless clients that can only do useful things when you have
        an internet connection (just about the only thing you could do offline was to scroll up and down in
        a page that you had previously loaded while online). However, recent “single-page” JavaScript web apps
        have gained a lot of stateful capabilities, including client-side user interface interaction and
        persistent local storage in the web browser. Mobile apps can similarly store a lot of state on the
        device and don’t require a round-trip to the server for most user interactions.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="offline-first applications" id="idm45085099331040"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="locality (data access)" data-secondary="in stateful clients" id="idm45085099330192"></a>
        These changing capabilities have led to a renewed interest in <em>offline-first</em> applications that do
        as much as possible using a local database on the same device, without requiring an internet
        connection, and sync with remote servers in the background when a network connection is available
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Feyerke2013wd-marker" href="ch12.html#Feyerke2013wd">42</a>]. Since mobile devices often have slow and unreliable
        cellular internet connections, it’s a big advantage for users if their user interface does not have
        to wait for synchronous network requests, and if apps mostly work offline (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_offline_clients">“Clients with offline operation”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>When we move away from the assumption of stateless clients talking to a central database and
        toward state that is maintained on end-user devices, a world of new opportunities opens up. In
        particular, we can think of the on-device state as a <em>cache of state on the server</em>. The pixels on
        the screen are a materialized view onto model objects in the client app; the model objects are a local
        replica of state in a remote datacenter [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Kleppmann2014ht">27</a>].</p>

        In a typical web page, if you load the page in a web browser and the data subsequently changes on
        the server, the browser does not find out about the change until you reload the page. The browser
        only reads the data at one point in time, assuming that it is static—it does not subscribe to
        updates from the server. Thus, the state in the browser is a stale cache that is not updated unless
        you explicitly poll for changes. (HTTP-based feed subscription protocols like RSS are really just a
        basic form of polling.)</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="WebSocket (protocol)" id="idm45085099317072"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="EventSource (browser API)" id="idm45085099316240"></a>
        More recent protocols have moved beyond the basic request/response pattern of HTTP: server-sent
        events (the EventSource API) and WebSockets provide communication channels by which a web browser can
        keep an open TCP connection to a server, and the server can actively push messages to the browser as
        long as it remains connected. This provides an opportunity for the server to actively inform the
        end-user client about any changes to the state it has stored locally, reducing the staleness of the
        client-side state.</p>
        
        <p>In terms of our model of write path and read path, actively pushing state changes all the way to
        client devices means extending the write path all the way to the end user. When a client is first
        initialized, it would still need to use a read path to get its initial state, but thereafter it
        could rely on a stream of state changes sent by the server. The ideas we discussed around stream
        processing and messaging are not restricted to running only in a datacenter: we can take the ideas
        further, and extend them all the way to end-user devices
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Burckhardt2015hv-marker" href="ch12.html#Burckhardt2015hv">43</a>].</p>
        
        <p>The devices will be offline some of the time, and unable to receive any notifications of state
        changes from the server during that time. But we already solved that problem: in
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_log_offsets">“Consumer offsets”</a> we discussed how a consumer of a log-based message broker can reconnect
        after failing or becoming disconnected, and ensure that it doesn’t miss any messages that arrived
        while it was disconnected. The same technique works for individual users, where each device is a
        small subscriber to a small stream of events.</p>

        React, Flux, and Redux [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Soper2015ue-marker" href="ch12.html#Soper2015ue">44</a>],
        already manage internal client-side state by subscribing to a stream of events representing user
        input or responses from a server, structured similarly to event sourcing (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_event_sourcing">“Event Sourcing”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>It would be very natural to extend this programming model to also allow a server to push
        state-change events into this client-side event pipeline. Thus, state changes could flow through an
        end-to-end write path: from the interaction on one device that triggers a state change, via event
        logs and through several derived data systems and stream processors, all the way to the user
        interface of a person observing the state on another device. These state changes could be propagated
        with fairly low delay—say, under one second end to end.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="real-time" data-secondary="publish/subscribe dataflow" id="idm45085099296800"></a>
        Some applications, such as instant messaging and online games, already have such a “real-time”
        architecture (in the sense of interactions with low delay, not in the sense of
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_clocks_realtime">“Response time guarantees”</a>). But why don’t we build all applications this way?</p>
        
        <p>The challenge is that the assumption of stateless clients and request/response interactions is very
        deeply ingrained in our databases, libraries, frameworks, and protocols. Many datastores support
        read and write operations where a request returns one response, but much fewer provide an ability to
        subscribe to changes—i.e., a request that returns a stream of responses over time (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_change_api">“API support for change streams”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>In order to extend the write path all the way to the end user, we would need to fundamentally
        rethink the way we build many of these systems: moving away from request/response interaction and
        toward publish/subscribe dataflow [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Kleppmann2014ht">27</a>]. I
        think that the advantages of more responsive user interfaces and better offline support would make
        it worth the effort. If you are designing data systems, I hope that you will keep in mind the option
        of subscribing to changes, not just querying the current state.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="events" data-secondary="reads as" id="idm45085099288784"></a>
        We discussed that when a stream processor writes derived data to a store (database, cache, or index),
        and when user requests query that store, the store acts as the boundary between the write path
        and the read path. The store allows random-access read queries to the data that would otherwise
        require scanning the whole event log.</p>
        
        <p>In many cases, the data storage is separate from the streaming system. But recall that stream
        processors also need to maintain state to perform aggregations and joins (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_joins">“Stream Joins”</a>).
        This state is normally hidden inside the stream processor, but some frameworks allow it to also be
        queried by outside clients
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Thereska2016ul-marker" href="ch12.html#Thereska2016ul">45</a>],
        turning the stream processor itself into a kind of simple database.</p>
        
        <p>I would like to take that idea further. As discussed so far, the writes to the store go through an
        event log, while reads are transient network requests that go directly to the nodes that store the
        data being queried. This is a reasonable design, but not the only possible one. It is also possible
        to represent read requests as streams of events, and send both the read events and the write events
        through a stream processor; the processor responds to read events by emitting the result of the read
        to an output stream [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="McSherry2016vk-marker" href="ch12.html#McSherry2016vk">46</a>].</p>
        
        <p>When both the writes and the reads are represented as events, and routed to the same stream operator
        in order to be handled, we are in fact performing a stream-table join between the stream of read
        queries and the database. The read event needs to be sent to the database partition holding the data
        (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#sec_partitioning_routing">“Request Routing”</a>), just like batch and stream processors need to copartition inputs
        on the same key when joining (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_reduce_joins">“Reduce-Side Joins and Grouping”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>This correspondence between serving requests and performing joins is quite fundamental
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Alvaro2015vs-marker" href="ch12.html#Alvaro2015vs">47</a>]. A one-off read request just passes the request through the join
        operator and then immediately forgets it; a subscribe request is a persistent join with past and
        future events on the other side of the join.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="causal dependencies" data-secondary="capturing" id="idm45085099274496"></a>
        Recording a log of read events potentially also has benefits with regard to tracking causal
        dependencies and data provenance across a system: it would allow you to reconstruct what the user
        saw before they made a particular decision. For example, in an online shop, it is likely that the
        predicted shipping date and the inventory status shown to a customer affect whether they choose to
        buy an item [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Kerr2016va">4</a>]. To analyze this connection,
        you need to record the result of the user’s query of the shipping and inventory status.</p>
        
        <p>Writing read events to durable storage thus enables better tracking of causal dependencies (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_capture_causality">“Ordering events to capture causality”</a>), but it incurs additional storage and I/O cost. Optimizing such
        systems to reduce the overhead is still an open research problem
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Ajoux2015wh_ch12">2</a>]. But if you already log read requests
        for operational purposes, as a side effect of request processing, it is not such a great change to
        make the log the source of the requests instead.</p>

        For queries that only touch a single partition, the effort of sending queries through a stream and
        collecting a stream of responses is perhaps overkill. However, this idea opens the possibility of
        distributed execution of complex queries that need to combine data from several partitions, taking
        advantage of the infrastructure for message routing, partitioning, and joining that is already
        provided by stream processors.</p>

        Storm’s distributed RPC feature supports this usage pattern (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_actors_drpc">“Message passing and RPC”</a>). For
        example, it has been used to compute the number of people who have seen a URL on Twitter—i.e., the
        union of the follower sets of everyone who has tweeted that URL

        As the set of Twitter users is partitioned, this computation requires combining results from many
        partitions.</p>
        
        <p>Another example of this pattern occurs in fraud prevention: in order to assess the risk of whether a

        address, email address, billing address, shipping address, and so on. Each of these reputation
        databases is itself partitioned, and so collecting the scores for a particular purchase event

        <p>The internal query execution graphs of MPP databases have similar characteristics (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_mr_vs_db">“Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases”</a>). If you need to perform this kind of multi-partition join, it is probably
        simpler to use a database that provides this feature than to implement it using a stream processor.
        However, treating queries as streams provides an option for implementing large-scale applications
        that run against the limits of conventional off-the-shelf solutions.

        With stateless services that only read data, it is not a big deal if something goes wrong: you can
        fix the bug and restart the service, and everything returns to normal. Stateful systems such as
        databases are not so simple: they are designed to remember things forever (more or less), so if
        something goes wrong, the effects also potentially last forever—which means they require more
        careful thought [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Majors2016wo-marker" href="ch12.html#Majors2016wo">50</a>].</p>
        
        <p>We want to build applications that are reliable and <em>correct</em> (i.e., programs whose semantics are
        well defined and understood, even in the face of various faults). For approximately four decades,
        the transaction properties of atomicity, isolation, and durability (<a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch_transactions">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>) have been
        the tools of choice for building correct applications. However, those foundations are weaker than
        they seem: witness for example the confusion of weak isolation levels (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_isolation_levels">“Weak Isolation Levels”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>In some areas, transactions are being abandoned entirely and replaced with models that offer
        better performance and scalability, but much messier semantics (see for example
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_leaderless">“Leaderless Replication”</a>). <em>Consistency</em> is often talked about, but poorly defined (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid_consistency">“Consistency”</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch_consistency">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>). Some people assert that we should
        “embrace weak consistency” for the sake of better availability, while lacking a clear idea of what
        that actually means in practice.</p>

        For a topic that is so important, our understanding and our engineering methods are surprisingly
        flaky.&nbsp;For example, it is very difficult to determine whether it is safe to run a particular
        application at a particular transaction isolation level or replication configuration
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Bernstein2000jk-marker" href="ch12.html#Bernstein2000jk">51</a>,

        Often simple solutions appear to work correctly when concurrency is low and there are no faults, but
        turn out to have many subtle bugs in more demanding circumstances.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Jepsen (fault tolerance testing)" id="idm45085099224432"></a>
        For example, Kyle Kingsbury’s Jepsen experiments
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="KingsburyJepsen-marker" href="ch12.html#KingsburyJepsen">53</a>]
        have highlighted the stark discrepancies between some products’ claimed safety guarantees and their
        actual behavior in the presence of network problems and crashes. Even if infrastructure products
        like databases were free from problems, application code would still need to correctly use the
        features they provide, which is error-prone if the configuration is hard to understand (which is the
        case with weak isolation levels, quorum configurations, and so on).</p>
        
        <p>If your application can tolerate occasionally corrupting or losing data in unpredictable ways, life
        is a lot simpler, and you might be able to get away with simply crossing your fingers and hoping for
        the best. On the other hand, if you need stronger assurances of correctness, then serializability and
        atomic commit are established approaches, but they come at a cost: they typically only work in a
        single datacenter (ruling out geographically distributed architectures), and they limit the scale
        and fault-tolerance properties you can achieve.</p>
        
        <p>While the traditional transaction approach is not going away, I also believe it is not the last word
        in making applications correct and resilient to faults. In this section I will suggest some ways of
        thinking about correctness in the context of dataflow architectures.</p>

        <h2>The End-to-End Argument for Databases</h2>
        
        <p>Just because an application uses a data system that provides comparatively strong safety properties,
        such as serializable transactions, that does not mean the application is guaranteed to be free from
        data loss or corruption. For example, if an application has a bug that causes it to write incorrect
        data, or delete data from a database, serializable transactions aren’t going to save you.</p>
        
        <p>This example may seem frivolous, but it is worth taking seriously: application bugs occur, and
        people make mistakes. I used this example in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability">“State, Streams, and Immutability”</a> to argue in favor of
        immutable and append-only data, because it is easier to recover from such mistakes if you remove the
        ability of faulty code to destroy good data.</p>
        
        <p>Although immutability is useful, it is not a cure-all by itself. Let’s look at a more subtle example
        of data corruption that can occur.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="effectively-once semantics" id="idm45085099212464"></a>
        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance">“Fault Tolerance”</a> we encountered an idea called <em>exactly-once</em> (or
        <em>effectively-once</em>) semantics. If something goes wrong while processing a message, you can either
        give up (drop the message—i.e., incur data loss) or try again. If you try again, there is the risk
        that it actually succeeded the first time, but you just didn’t find out about the success, and so
        the message ends up being processed twice.</p>
        
        <p>Processing twice is a form of data corruption: it is undesirable to charge a customer twice for the
        same service (billing them too much) or increment a counter twice (overstating some metric). In this
        context, <em>exactly-once</em> means arranging the computation such that the final effect is the same as if
        no faults had occurred, even if the operation actually was retried due to some fault. We previously
        discussed a few approaches for achieving this goal.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="idempotence" data-secondary="idempotent operations" id="idm45085099207968"></a>

        One of the most effective approaches is to make the operation <em>idempotent</em> (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence">“Idempotence”</a>); that is, to ensure that it has the same effect, no matter whether it is
        executed once or multiple times. However, taking an operation that is not naturally idempotent and
        making it idempotent requires some effort and care: you may need to maintain some additional
        metadata (such as the set of operation IDs that have updated a value), and ensure fencing when
        failing over from one node to another (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_lock_fencing">“The leader and the lock”</a>).</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Duplicate suppression"><div class="sect3" id="idm45085099201696">
        <h3>Duplicate suppression</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="duplicates, suppression of" data-seealso="idempotence" id="idm45085099200320"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)" data-secondary="reliability and duplicate suppression" id="idm45085099199248"></a>
        The same pattern of needing to suppress duplicates occurs in many other places besides stream
        processing. For example, TCP uses sequence numbers on packets to put them in the correct order at
        the recipient, and to determine whether any packets were lost or duplicated on the network. Any lost
        packets are retransmitted and any duplicates are removed by the TCP stack before it hands the data
        to an application.</p>
        
        <p>However, this duplicate suppression only works within the context of a single TCP connection.
        Imagine the TCP connection is a client’s connection to a database, and it is currently executing the
        transaction in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_non_idempotent">Example&nbsp;12-1</a>. In many databases, a transaction is tied to a client
        connection (if the client sends several queries, the database knows that they belong to the same
        transaction because they are sent on the same TCP connection). If the client suffers a network
        interruption and connection timeout after sending the <code>COMMIT</code>, but before hearing back from the
        database server, it does not know whether the transaction has been committed or aborted
        (<a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#fig_distributed_network">Figure&nbsp;8-1</a>).</p>
        <div id="fig_future_non_idempotent" data-type="example">
        <h5><span class="label">Example 12-1. </span>A nonidempotent transfer of money from one account to another</h5>

        <code class="k">COMMIT</code><code class="p">;</code></pre></div>
        
        <p>The client can reconnect to the database and retry the transaction, but now it is outside of the
        scope of TCP duplicate suppression. Since the transaction in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_non_idempotent">Example&nbsp;12-1</a> is not
        idempotent, it could happen that $22 is transferred instead of the desired $11. Thus, even though
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_non_idempotent">Example&nbsp;12-1</a> is a standard example for transaction atomicity, it is actually not
        correct, and real banks do not work like this
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Helland2009vd">3</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Two-phase commit (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc">“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”</a>) protocols break the 1:1 mapping between a TCP
        connection and a transaction, since they must allow a transaction coordinator to reconnect to a
        database after a network fault, and tell it whether to commit or abort an in-doubt transaction. Is
        this sufficient to ensure that the transaction will only be executed once? Unfortunately not.</p>
        
        <p>Even if we can suppress duplicate transactions between the database client and server, we still need
        to worry about the network between the end-user device and the application server. For example, if
        the end-user client is a web browser, it probably uses an HTTP POST request to submit an instruction
        to the server. Perhaps the user is on a weak cellular data connection, and they succeed in sending
        the POST, but the signal becomes too weak before they are able to receive the response from the
        server.</p>
        
        <p>In this case, the user will probably be shown an error message, and they may retry manually. Web
        browsers warn, “Are you sure you want to submit this form again?”—and the user says yes, because
        they wanted the operation to happen. (The Post/Redirect/Get pattern
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Jouravlev2004wh-marker" href="ch12.html#Jouravlev2004wh">54</a>] avoids this warning message in normal
        operation, but it doesn’t help if the POST request times out.) From the web server’s point of view
        the retry is a separate request, and from the database’s point of view it is a separate transaction.
        The usual deduplication mechanisms don’t help.</p>

        To make the request idempotent through several hops of network communication, it is not sufficient
        to rely just on a transaction mechanism provided by a database—you need to consider the <em>end-to-end</em>
        flow of the request.</p>
        
        <p>For example, you could generate a unique identifier for a request (such as a UUID) and include it
        as a hidden form field in the client application, or calculate a hash of all the relevant form
        fields to derive the request ID [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Helland2009vd">3</a>]. If
        the web browser submits the POST request twice, the two requests will have the same request ID.
        You can then pass that request ID all the way through to the database and check that you only ever
        execute one request with a given ID, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_request_id">Example&nbsp;12-2</a>.</p>

        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_request_id">Example&nbsp;12-2</a> relies on a uniqueness constraint on the <code>request_id</code> column. If a

        check-then-insert may fail under nonserializable isolation, as discussed in

        The updates to the account balances don’t actually have to happen in the same transaction as the
        insertion of the event, since they are redundant and could be derived from the request event in a

        using the request ID.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="end-to-end argument" id="ix_enddb"></a>
        This scenario of suppressing duplicate transactions is just one example of a more general principle
        called the <em>end-to-end argument</em>, which was articulated by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark in 1984
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Saltzer1984do_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Saltzer1984do_ch12">55</a>]:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and
        help of the application standing at the endpoints of the communication system. Therefore, providing
        that questioned function as a feature of the communication system itself is not possible. (Sometimes
        an incomplete version of the function provided by the communication system may be useful as a
        performance enhancement.)</p></blockquote>
        
        <p>In our example, the <em>function in question</em> was duplicate suppression. We saw that TCP suppresses
        duplicate packets at the TCP connection level, and some stream processors provide so-called
        exactly-once semantics at the message processing level, but that is not enough to prevent a user
        from submitting a duplicate request if the first one times out.  By themselves, TCP, database
        transactions, and stream processors cannot entirely rule out these duplicates. Solving the problem
        requires an end-to-end solution: a transaction identifier that is passed all the way from the
        end-user client to the database.</p>

        The end-to-end argument also applies to checking the integrity of data: checksums built into
        Ethernet, TCP, and TLS can detect corruption of packets in the network, but they cannot detect
        corruption due to bugs in the software at the sending and receiving ends of the network connection,
        or corruption on the disks where the data is stored. If you want to catch all possible sources of
        data corruption, you also need end-to-end checksums.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cryptography" data-secondary="end-to-end encryption and authentication" id="idm45085098973040"></a>
        A similar argument applies with encryption
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Saltzer1984do_ch12">55</a>]:
        the password on your home WiFi network protects against people snooping your WiFi traffic, but not
        against attackers elsewhere on the internet; TLS/SSL between your client and the server protects
        against network attackers, but not against compromises of the server. Only end-to-end encryption and
        authentication can protect against all of these things.</p>
        
        <p>Although the low-level features (TCP duplicate suppression, Ethernet checksums, WiFi encryption)
        cannot provide the desired end-to-end features by themselves, they are still useful, since they
        reduce the probability of problems at the higher levels. For example, HTTP requests would often get
        mangled if we didn’t have TCP putting the packets back in the right order. We just need to remember
        that the low-level reliability features are not by themselves sufficient to ensure end-to-end
        correctness.</p>

        <h3>Applying end-to-end thinking in data systems</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fault tolerance" data-secondary="in log-based systems" id="idm45085098968240"></a>
        This brings me back to my original thesis: just because an application uses a data system that
        provides comparatively strong safety properties, such as serializable transactions, that does not
        mean the application is guaranteed to be free from data loss or corruption. The application itself
        needs to take end-to-end measures, such as duplicate suppression, as well.</p>
        
        <p>That is a shame, because fault-tolerance mechanisms are hard to get right. Low-level reliability
        mechanisms, such as those in TCP, work quite well, and so the remaining higher-level faults occur
        fairly rarely. It would be really nice to wrap up the remaining high-level fault-tolerance machinery
        in an abstraction so that application code needn’t worry about it—but I fear that we have not yet
        found the right abstraction.</p>
        
        <p>Transactions have long been seen as a good abstraction, and I do believe that they are useful. As
        discussed in the introduction to <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch_transactions">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>, they take a wide range of possible issues
        (concurrent writes, constraint violations, crashes, network interruptions, disk failures) and
        collapse them down to two possible outcomes: commit or abort. That is a huge simplification of the
        programming model, but I fear that it is not enough.</p>
        
        <p>Transactions are expensive, especially when they involve heterogeneous storage technologies (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans">“Distributed Transactions in Practice”</a>). When we refuse to use distributed transactions because they are too
        expensive, we end up having to reimplement fault-tolerance mechanisms in application code. As
        numerous examples throughout this book have shown, reasoning about concurrency and partial failure
        is difficult and counterintuitive, and so I suspect that most application-level mechanisms do not
        work correctly. The consequence is lost or corrupted data.</p>
        
        <p>For these reasons, I think it is worth exploring fault-tolerance abstractions that make it easy to
        provide application-specific end-to-end correctness properties, but also maintain good performance
        and good operational characteristics in a large-scale distributed environment.

        Let’s think about correctness in the context of the ideas around unbundling databases
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_unbundling">“Unbundling Databases”</a>). We saw that end-to-end duplicate suppression can be achieved with a
        request ID that is passed all the way from the client to the database that records the write. What
        about other kinds of constraints?</p>
        
        <p>In particular, let’s focus on uniqueness constraints—such as the one we relied on in
        <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_request_id">Example&nbsp;12-2</a>. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_uniqueness">“Constraints and uniqueness guarantees”</a> we saw several other examples of
        application features that need to enforce uniqueness: a username or email address must uniquely
        identify a user, a file storage service cannot have more than one file with the same name, and two
        people cannot book the same seat on a flight or in a theater.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="meeting room booking (example)" id="idm45085098948352"></a>
        Other kinds of constraints are very similar: for example, ensuring that an account balance never goes
        negative, that you don’t sell more items than you have in stock in the warehouse, or that a meeting
        room does not have overlapping bookings. Techniques that enforce uniqueness can often be used for
        these kinds of constraints as well.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="uniqueness constraints" data-secondary="requiring consensus" id="idm45085098942048"></a>
        In <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch_consistency">Chapter&nbsp;9</a> we saw that in a distributed setting, enforcing a uniqueness constraint
        requires consensus: if there are several concurrent requests with the same value, the system somehow
        needs to decide which one of the conflicting operations is accepted, and reject the others as
        violations of the constraint.</p>
        
        <p>The most common way of achieving this consensus is to make a single node the leader, and put it in
        charge of making all the decisions. That works fine as long as you don’t mind funneling all requests
        through a single node (even if the client is on the other side of the world), and as long as that
        node doesn’t fail. If you need to tolerate the leader failing, you’re back at the consensus problem
        again (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_consensus_leader">“Single-leader replication and consensus”</a>).</p>
        
        <p>Uniqueness checking can be scaled out by partitioning based on the value that needs to be unique.
        For example, if you need to ensure uniqueness by request ID, as in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_request_id">Example&nbsp;12-2</a>, you
        can ensure all requests with the same request ID are routed to the same partition (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch_partitioning">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>). If you need usernames to be unique, you can partition by hash of username.</p>
        
        <p>However, asynchronous multi-master replication is ruled out, because it could happen that different
        masters concurrently accept conflicting writes, and thus the values are no longer unique (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_implementing_linearizable">“Implementing Linearizable Systems”</a>). If you want to be able to immediately reject any
        writes that would violate the constraint, synchronous coordination is unavoidable

        A log ensures that all consumers see messages in the same order—a guarantee that is formally known
        as <em>total order broadcast</em> and is equivalent to consensus (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_total_order">“Total Order Broadcast”</a>). In
        the unbundled database approach with log-based messaging, we can use a very similar approach to
        enforce uniqueness constraints.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single-threaded execution" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085098923952"></a>
        A stream processor consumes all the messages in a log partition sequentially on a single thread (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_logs_vs_messaging">“Logs compared to traditional messaging”</a>). Thus, if the log is partitioned based on the value that needs to
        be unique, a stream processor can unambiguously and deterministically decide which one of several
        conflicting operations came first in the log. For example, in the case of several users trying to
        claim the same username [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Yarmula2016wv-marker" href="ch12.html#Yarmula2016wv">57</a>]:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Every request for a username is encoded as a message, and appended to a partition determined by
        the hash of the username.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="locality (data access)" data-secondary="in stream processing" id="idm45085098917568"></a>
        A stream processor sequentially reads the requests in the log, using a local database to keep
        track of which usernames are taken. For every request for a username that is available, it
        records the name as taken and emits a success message to an output stream. For every request for
        a username that is already taken, it emits a rejection message to an output stream.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The client that requested the username watches the output stream and waits for a success or
        rejection message corresponding to its request.</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>This algorithm is basically the same as in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_abcast_to_lin">“Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast”</a>. It scales easily to a
        large request throughput by increasing the number of partitions, as each partition can be processed
        independently.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Bayou (database)" id="idm45085098911984"></a>
        The approach works not only for uniqueness constraints, but also for many other kinds of constraints.
        Its fundamental principle is that any writes that may conflict are routed to the same partition and
        processed sequentially. As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_what_is_conflict">“What is a conflict?”</a> and
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_write_skew">“Write Skew and Phantoms”</a>, the definition of a conflict may depend on the application, but the
        stream processor can use arbitrary logic to validate a request. This idea is similar to the approach
        pioneered by Bayou in the 1990s

        Ensuring that an operation is executed atomically, while satisfying constraints, becomes more
        interesting when several partitions are involved. In <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_future_request_id">Example&nbsp;12-2</a>, there are
        potentially three partitions: the one containing the request ID, the one containing the payee
        account, and the one containing the payer account. There is no reason why those three things should
        be in the same partition, since they are all independent from each other.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="coordination" data-secondary="cross-partition ordering" id="idm45085098897168"></a>
        In the traditional approach to databases, executing this transaction would require an atomic commit
        across all three partitions, which essentially forces it into a total order with respect to all
        other transactions on any of those partitions. Since there is now cross-partition coordination,
        different partitions can no longer be processed independently, so throughput is likely to suffer.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="atomicity (transactions)" data-secondary="atomic commit" data-tertiary="avoiding" id="idm45085098895440"></a>
        However, it turns out that equivalent correctness can be achieved with partitioned logs, and without
        an atomic commit:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>The request to transfer money from account A to account B is given a unique request ID by the
        client, and appended to a log partition based on the request ID.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>A stream processor reads the log of requests. For each request message it emits two messages to
        output streams: a debit instruction to the payer account A (partitioned by A), and a credit
        instruction to the payee account B (partitioned by B). The original request ID is included in
        those emitted messages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Further processors consume the streams of credit and debit instructions, deduplicate by request ID,
        and apply the changes to the account balances.</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>Steps 1 and 2 are necessary because if the client directly sent the credit and debit instructions,
        it would require an atomic commit across those two partitions to ensure that either both or neither
        happen. To avoid the need for a distributed transaction, we first durably log the request as a
        single message, and then derive the credit and debit instructions from that first message.
        Single-object writes are atomic in almost all data systems (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_single_object">“Single-object writes”</a>),
        and so the request either appears in the log or it doesn’t, without any need for a multi-partition
        atomic commit.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="checkpointing" data-secondary="in stream processors" id="idm45085098888144"></a>
        If the stream processor in step 2 crashes, it resumes processing from its last checkpoint. In doing
        so, it does not skip any request messages, but it may process requests multiple times and produce
        duplicate credit and debit instructions. However, since it is deterministic, it will just produce
        the same instructions again, and the processors in step 3 can easily deduplicate them using the
        end-to-end request ID.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to ensure that the payer account is not overdrawn by this transfer, you can additionally
        have a stream processor (partitioned by payer account number) that maintains account balances in a
        local database and validates transactions based on that state. Only valid transactions would then be
        placed in the request log in step 1.</p>
        
        <p>By breaking down the multi-partition transaction into two differently partitioned stages and using
        the end-to-end request ID, we have achieved the same correctness property (every request is applied
        exactly once to both the payer and payee accounts), even in the presence of faults, and without using
        an atomic commit protocol. The idea of using multiple differently partitioned stages is similar to
        what we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_unbundled_multi_partition">“Multi-partition data processing”</a> (see also <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_concurrency">“Concurrency control”</a>).

        <h2>Timeliness and Integrity</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="correctness" data-secondary="timeliness and integrity" id="ix_correcttimely"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fault tolerance" data-secondary="in log-based systems" id="ix_faulttollog"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="linearizability" data-secondary="of derived data systems" id="idm45085098876112"></a>
        A convenient property of transactions is that they are typically linearizable (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_linearizability">“Linearizability”</a>): that is, a writer waits until a transaction is committed, and
        thereafter its writes are immediately visible to all readers.</p>
        
        <p>This is not the case when unbundling an operation across multiple stages of stream processors:
        consumers of a log are asynchronous by design, so a sender does not wait until its message has been
        processed by consumers. However, it is possible for a client to wait for a message to appear on an
        output stream. This is what we did in <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_uniqueness_log">“Uniqueness in log-based messaging”</a> when checking whether a
        uniqueness constraint was satisfied.</p>
        
        <p>In this example, the correctness of the uniqueness check does not depend on whether the sender of
        the message waits for the outcome. The waiting only has the purpose of synchronously informing the
        sender whether or not the uniqueness check succeeded, but this notification can be decoupled from
        the effects of processing the message.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consistency" id="idm45085098871360"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="consistency" data-secondary="timeliness and integrity" id="idm45085098870528"></a>
        More generally, I think the term <em>consistency</em> conflates two different requirements that are worth
        considering separately:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>Timeliness</dt>
        <dd>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="timeliness" id="idm45085098867456"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="staleness (old data)" data-secondary="versus timeliness" id="idm45085098866624"></a>
        Timeliness means ensuring that users observe the system in an up-to-date state. We saw previously
        that if a user reads from a stale copy of the data, they may observe it in an inconsistent state
        (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_lag">“Problems with Replication Lag”</a>). However, that inconsistency is temporary, and will eventually be
        resolved simply by waiting and trying again.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="read-after-write consistency" id="idm45085098864112"></a>
        The CAP theorem (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_linearizability_cost">“The Cost of Linearizability”</a>) uses consistency in the sense of linearizability,
        which is a strong way of achieving timeliness. Weaker timeliness properties like <em>read-after-write</em>
        consistency (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_ryw">“Reading Your Own Writes”</a>) can also be useful.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Integrity</dt>
        <dd>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integrity" id="idm45085098859696"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="corruption of data" data-secondary="integrity as absence of" id="idm45085098858864"></a>
        Integrity means absence of corruption; i.e., no data loss, and no contradictory or false data. In
        particular, if some derived dataset is maintained as a view onto some underlying data (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_state_from_log">“Deriving current state from the event log”</a>), the derivation must be correct. For example, a database index must
        correctly reflect the contents of the database—an index in which some records are missing is
        not very useful.</p>
        
        <p>If integrity is violated, the inconsistency is permanent: waiting and trying again is not going to
        fix database corruption in most cases. Instead, explicit checking and repair is needed. In the
        context of ACID transactions (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid">“The Meaning of ACID”</a>), consistency is usually understood as
        some kind of application-specific notion of integrity. Atomicity and durability are important tools
        for preserving integrity.</p>
        </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="eventual consistency" data-secondary="and perpetual inconsistency" id="idm45085098854400"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perpetual inconsistency" id="idm45085098853280"></a>
        In slogan form: violations of timeliness are “eventual consistency,” whereas violations of integrity
        are “perpetual inconsistency.”</p>
        
        <p>I am going to assert that in most applications, integrity is much more important than timeliness.
        Violations of timeliness can be annoying and confusing, but violations of integrity can be
        catastrophic.</p>
        
        <p>For example, on your credit card statement, it is not surprising if a transaction that you made
        within the last 24 hours does not yet appear—it is normal that these systems have a certain lag.
        We know that banks reconcile and settle transactions asynchronously, and timeliness is not very
        important here [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Helland2009vd">3</a>]. However, it would be
        very bad if the statement balance was not equal to the sum of the transactions plus the previous
        statement balance (an error in the sums), or if a transaction was charged to you but not paid to the
        merchant (disappearing money). Such problems would be violations of the integrity of the system.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Correctness of dataflow systems"><div class="sect3" id="idm45085098849712">
        <h3>Correctness of dataflow systems</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integrity" data-secondary="correctness of dataflow systems" id="idm45085098848464"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dataflow" data-secondary="correctness of dataflow systems" id="idm45085098847312"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="timeliness" data-secondary="correctness of dataflow systems" id="idm45085098846112"></a>
        ACID transactions usually provide both timeliness (e.g., linearizability) and integrity (e.g.,
        atomic commit) guarantees. Thus, if you approach application correctness from the point of view of
        ACID transactions, the distinction between timeliness and integrity is fairly inconsequential.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, an interesting property of the event-based dataflow systems that we have
        discussed in this chapter is that they decouple timeliness and integrity. When processing event
        streams asynchronously, there is no guarantee of timeliness, unless you explicitly build consumers
        that wait for a message to arrive before returning. But integrity is in fact central to streaming
        systems.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exactly-once semantics" data-secondary="preservation of integrity" id="idm45085098843600"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="effectively-once semantics" data-secondary="preservation of integrity" id="idm45085098842480"></a>
        <em>Exactly-once</em> or <em>effectively-once</em> semantics (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance">“Fault Tolerance”</a>) is a mechanism
        for preserving integrity. If an event is lost, or if an event takes effect twice, the integrity of a
        data system could be violated. Thus, fault-tolerant message delivery and duplicate suppression
        (e.g., idempotent operations) are important for maintaining the integrity of a data system in the
        face of faults.</p>
        
        <p>As we saw in the last section, reliable stream processing systems can preserve integrity without
        requiring distributed transactions and an atomic commit protocol, which means they can potentially
        achieve comparable correctness with much better performance and operational robustness. We achieved
        this integrity through a combination of mechanisms:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="event sourcing" data-secondary="large, reliable data systems" id="idm45085098837584"></a>
        Representing the content of the write operation as a single message, which can easily be written
        atomically—an approach that fits very well with event sourcing (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_event_sourcing">“Event Sourcing”</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deterministic operations" data-secondary="computing derived data" id="idm45085098834720"></a>
        Deriving all other state updates from that single message using deterministic derivation
        functions, similarly to stored procedures (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_serial">“Actual Serial Execution”</a> and
        <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_dataflow_derivation">“Application code as a derivation function”</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Passing a client-generated request ID through all these levels of processing, enabling end-to-end
        duplicate suppression and idempotence</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Making messages immutable and allowing derived data to be reprocessed from time to time,
        which makes it easier to recover from bugs (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability_pros">“Advantages of immutable events”</a>)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This combination of mechanisms seems to me a very promising direction for building fault-tolerant
        applications in the future.

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="uniqueness constraints" data-secondary="asynchronously checked" id="idm45085098824320"></a>
        As discussed previously, enforcing a uniqueness constraint requires consensus, typically implemented by
        funneling all events in a particular partition through a single node. This limitation is unavoidable
        if we want the traditional form of uniqueness constraint, and stream processing cannot avoid it.</p>
        
        <p>However, another thing to realize is that many real applications can actually get away with much
        weaker notions of uniqueness:</p>

        If two people concurrently register the same username or book the same seat, you can send one of
        them a message to apologize, and ask them to choose a different one. This kind of change to correct
        a mistake is called a <em>compensating transaction</em> [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Gray1981wi_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Gray1981wi_ch12">59</a>,

        </li>
        <li>
        <p>If customers order more items than you have in your warehouse, you can order in more stock,
        apologize to customers for the delay, and offer them a discount. This is actually the same as what
        you’d have to do if, say, a forklift truck ran over some of the items in your warehouse, leaving you
        with fewer items in stock than you thought you had [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Helland2007tp-marker" href="ch12.html#Helland2007tp">61</a>]. Thus, the apology
        workflow already needs to be part of your business processes anyway in order to deal with forklift
        incidents, and so it might be unnecessary to require a linearizable constraint on the number of
        items in stock.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Similarly, many airlines overbook airplanes in the expectation that some passengers will miss
        their flight, and many hotels overbook rooms, expecting that some guests will cancel. In these
        cases, the constraint of “one person per seat” is deliberately violated for business reasons, and
        compensation processes (refunds, upgrades, providing a complimentary room at a neighboring hotel)
        are put in place to handle situations in which demand exceeds supply. Even if there was no
        overbooking, apology and compensation processes would be needed in order to deal with flights
        being cancelled due to bad weather or staff on strike—recovering from such issues is just a normal
        part of business [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Helland2009vd">3</a>].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>If someone withdraws more money than they have in their account, the bank can charge them an
        overdraft fee and ask them to pay back what they owe. By limiting the total withdrawals per day,
        the risk to the bank is bounded.</p>
        </li>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="conflicts" data-secondary="conflict resolution" data-tertiary="by apologizing" id="idm45085098804240"></a>
        In many business contexts, it is actually acceptable to temporarily violate a constraint and fix
        it up later by apologizing. The cost of the apology (in terms of money or reputation) varies, but it
        is often quite low: you can’t unsend an email, but you can send a follow-up email with a
        correction. If you accidentally charge a credit card twice, you can refund one of the
        charges, and the cost to you is just the processing fees and perhaps a customer complaint. Once
        money has been paid out of an ATM, you can’t directly get it back, although in principle you can
        send debt collectors to recover the money if the account was overdrawn and the customer won’t pay
        it back.</p>
        
        <p>Whether the cost of the apology is acceptable is a business decision. If it is acceptable, the
        traditional model of checking all constraints before even writing the data is unnecessarily
        restrictive, and a linearizable constraint is not needed. It may well be a reasonable choice to go
        ahead with a write optimistically, and to check the constraint after the fact. You can still ensure
        that the validation occurs before doing things that would be expensive to recover from, but that
        doesn’t imply you must do the validation before you even write the data.</p>
        
        <p>These applications <em>do</em> require integrity: you would not want to lose a reservation, or have money
        disappear due to mismatched credits and debits. But they <em>don’t</em> require timeliness on the
        enforcement of the constraint: if you have sold more items than you have in the warehouse, you can
        patch up the problem after the fact by apologizing. Doing so is similar to the conflict resolution
        approaches we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#sec_replication_write_conflicts">“Handling Write Conflicts”</a>.</p>

        <h3>Coordination-avoiding data systems</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="constraints (databases)" data-secondary="coordination avoidance" id="idm45085098797200"></a>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="linearizability" data-secondary="of derived data systems" data-tertiary="avoiding coordination" id="idm45085098794992"></a>
        We have now made two interesting observations:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Dataflow systems can maintain integrity guarantees on derived data without atomic commit,
        linearizability, or synchronous cross-partition coordination.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Although strict uniqueness constraints require timeliness and coordination, many applications are
        actually fine with loose constraints that may be temporarily violated and fixed up later, as long
        as integrity is preserved throughout.</p>
        </li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="timeliness" data-secondary="coordination-avoiding data systems" id="idm45085098790704"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="integrity" data-secondary="coordination-avoiding data systems" id="idm45085098789584"></a>
        Taken together, these observations mean that dataflow systems can provide the data management
        services for many applications without requiring coordination, while still giving strong integrity
        guarantees. Such <em>coordination-avoiding</em> data systems have a lot of appeal: they can achieve better
        performance and fault tolerance than systems that need to perform synchronous coordination
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Bailis2014th_ch12">56</a>].</p>
        
        <p>For example, such a system could operate distributed across multiple datacenters in a multi-leader
        configuration, asynchronously replicating between regions. Any one datacenter can continue operating
        independently from the others, because no synchronous cross-region coordination is required. Such a
        system would have weak timeliness guarantees—it could not be linearizable without introducing
        coordination—but it can still have strong integrity guarantees.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="atomicity (transactions)" data-secondary="atomic commit" data-tertiary="avoiding" id="idm45085098785664"></a>
        In this context, serializable transactions are still useful as part of maintaining derived state,
        but they can be run at a small scope where they work well
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Helland2007td_ch12">8</a>].
        Heterogeneous distributed transactions such as XA transactions (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans">“Distributed Transactions in Practice”</a>)
        are not required. Synchronous coordination can still be introduced in places where it is needed (for
        example, to enforce strict constraints before an operation from which recovery is not possible), but
        there is no need for everything to pay the cost of coordination if only a small part of an
        application needs it [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Burckhardt2015hv">43</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Another way of looking at coordination and constraints: they reduce the number of apologies you have
        to make due to inconsistencies, but potentially also reduce the performance and availability of your
        system, and thus potentially increase the number of apologies you have to make due to outages. You
        cannot reduce the number of apologies to zero, but you can aim to find the best trade-off for your

        All of our discussion of correctness, integrity, and fault-tolerance has been under the assumption
        that certain things might go wrong, but other things won’t. We call these assumptions our <em>system
        model</em> (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_model_real_world">“Mapping system models to the real world”</a>): for example, we should assume that processes can
        crash, machines can suddenly lose power, and the network can arbitrarily delay or drop messages. But
        we might also assume that data written to disk is not lost after <code>fsync</code>, that data in memory is not
        corrupted, and that the multiplication instruction of our CPU always returns the correct result.</p>
        
        <p>These assumptions are quite reasonable, as they are true most of the time, and it would be difficult
        to get anything done if we had to constantly worry about our computers making mistakes.
        Traditionally, system models take a binary approach toward faults: we assume that some things can
        happen, and other things can never happen. In reality, it is more a question of probabilities: some
        things are more likely, other things less likely. The question is whether violations of our
        assumptions happen often enough that we may encounter them in practice.</p>

        We have seen that data can become corrupted while it is sitting untouched on disks (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sidebar_transactions_durability">“Replication and Durability”</a>), and data corruption on the network can sometimes evade the TCP
        checksums (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_weak_lying">“Weak forms of lying”</a>). Maybe this is something we should be paying more
        attention to?</p>

        One application that I worked on in the past collected crash reports from clients, and some of the
        reports we received could only be explained by random bit-flips in the memory of those devices. It
        seems unlikely, but if you have enough devices running your software, even very unlikely things do
        happen.

        Besides random memory corruption due to hardware faults or radiation, certain pathological memory

        Besides such hardware issues, there is always the risk of software bugs, which would not be caught
        by lower-level network, memory, or filesystem checksums. Even widely used database software has
        bugs: I have personally seen cases of MySQL failing to correctly maintain a uniqueness constraint
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="MySQL73170-marker" href="ch12.html#MySQL73170">65</a>]
        and PostgreSQL’s serializable isolation level exhibiting write skew anomalies
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Fredericks2015pg_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Fredericks2015pg_ch12">66</a>], even though MySQL and PostgreSQL are robust and
        well-regarded databases that have been battle-tested by many people for many years. In less mature
        software, the situation is likely to be much worse.</p>
        
        <p>Despite considerable efforts in careful design, testing, and review, bugs still creep in. Although
        they are rare, and they eventually get found and fixed, there is still a period during which such
        bugs can corrupt data.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="correctness" data-secondary="of transactions" id="idm45085098739456"></a>
        When it comes to application code, we have to assume many more bugs, since most applications don’t
        receive anywhere near the amount of review and testing that database code does. Many applications
        don’t even correctly use the features that databases offer for preserving integrity, such as foreign
        key or uniqueness constraints [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Bailis2015dn">36</a>].</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ACID properties (transactions)" data-secondary="consistency" id="idm45085098735808"></a>
        Consistency in the sense of ACID (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid_consistency">“Consistency”</a>) is based on the idea
        that the database starts off in a consistent state, and a transaction transforms it from
        one consistent state to another consistent state. Thus, we expect the database to always be in a
        consistent state. However, this notion only makes sense if you assume that the transaction is free
        from bugs. If the application uses the database incorrectly in some way, for example using a weak
        isolation level unsafely, the integrity of the database cannot be guaranteed.</p>

        With both hardware and software not always living up to the ideal that we would like them to be, it
        seems that data corruption is inevitable sooner or later. Thus, we should at least have a way of
        finding out if data has been corrupted so that we can fix it and try to track down the source of the
        error. Checking the integrity of data is known as <em>auditing</em>.</p>
        
        <p>As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability_pros">“Advantages of immutable events”</a>, auditing is not just for financial applications.
        However, auditability is highly important in finance precisely because everyone knows that mistakes
        happen, and we all recognize the need to be able to detect and fix problems.</p>

        Mature systems similarly tend to consider the possibility of unlikely things going wrong, and manage
        that risk. For example, large-scale storage systems such as HDFS and Amazon S3 do not fully trust
        disks: they run background processes that continually read back files, compare them to other
        replicas, and move files from one disk to another, in order to mitigate the risk of silent
        corruption [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Chen2016rq-marker" href="ch12.html#Chen2016rq">67</a>].</p>

        If you want to be sure that your data is still there, you have to actually read it and check. Most
        of the time it will still be there, but if it isn’t, you really want to find out sooner rather than
        later. By the same argument, it is important to try restoring from your backups from time to
        time—otherwise you may only find out that your backup is broken when it is too late and you have
        already lost data. Don’t just blindly trust that it is all working.</p>

        Systems like HDFS and S3 still have to assume that disks work correctly most of the time—which is a
        reasonable assumption, but not the same as assuming that they <em>always</em> work correctly.  However, not
        many systems currently have this kind of “trust, but verify” approach of continually auditing
        themselves. Many assume that correctness guarantees are absolute and make no provision for the
        possibility of rare data corruption. I hope that in the future we will see more <em>self-validating</em> or
        <em>self-auditing</em> systems that continually check their own integrity, rather than relying on blind
        trust [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kreps2012td_ch12-marker" href="ch12.html#Kreps2012td_ch12">68</a>].</p>
        
        <p>I fear that the culture of ACID databases has led us toward developing applications on the basis of
        blindly trusting technology (such as a transaction mechanism), and neglecting any sort of
        auditability in the process. Since the technology we trusted worked well enough most of the time,
        auditing mechanisms were not deemed worth the investment.</p>
        
        <p>But then the database landscape changed: weaker consistency guarantees became the norm under the
        banner of NoSQL, and less mature storage technologies became widely used. Yet, because the audit
        mechanisms had not been developed, we continued building applications on the basis of blind trust,
        even though this approach had now become more dangerous. Let’s think for a moment about designing
        for auditability.</p>

        If a transaction mutates several objects in a database, it is difficult to tell after the fact what
        that transaction means. Even if you capture the transaction logs (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc">“Change Data Capture”</a>), the
        insertions, updates, and deletions in various tables do not necessarily give a clear picture of
        <em>why</em> those mutations were performed. The invocation of the application logic that decided on those
        mutations is transient and cannot be reproduced.</p>

        By contrast, event-based systems can provide better auditability. In the event sourcing approach,
        user input to the system is represented as a single immutable event, and any resulting state updates
        are derived from that event. The derivation can be made deterministic and repeatable, so that
        running the same log of events through the same version of the derivation code will result in the
        same state updates.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="provenance of data" id="idm45085098693968"></a>
        Being explicit about dataflow (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#sec_batch_philosophy">“Philosophy of batch process outputs”</a>) makes the <em>provenance</em> of data much
        clearer, which makes integrity checking much more feasible. For the event log, we can use hashes to
        check that the event storage has not been corrupted. For any derived state, we can rerun the batch
        and stream processors that derived it from the event log in order to check whether we get the same
        result, or even run a redundant derivation in parallel.</p>
        
        <p>A deterministic and well-defined dataflow also makes it easier to debug and trace the execution of a

        If we cannot fully trust that every individual component of the system will be free from
        corruption—that every piece of hardware is fault-free and that every piece of software is
        bug-free—then we must at least periodically check the integrity of our data. If we don’t check, we
        won’t find out about corruption until it is too late and it has caused some downstream damage, at
        which point it will be much harder and more expensive to track down the problem.</p>
        
        <p>Checking the integrity of data systems is best done in an end-to-end fashion (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="#sec_future_end_to_end">“The End-to-End Argument for Databases”</a>): the more systems we can include in an integrity check, the fewer
        opportunities there are for corruption to go unnoticed at some stage of the process. If we can check
        that an entire derived data pipeline is correct end to end, then any disks, networks, services, and
        algorithms along the path are implicitly included in the check.</p>

        increases the chances that bugs will be found quickly, and thus reduces the risk that a change to
        the system or a new storage technology will cause damage. If you are not afraid of making changes,
        you can much better evolve an application to meet changing requirements.</p>

        At present, not many data systems make auditability a top-level concern. Some applications implement
        their own audit mechanisms, for example by logging all changes to a separate audit table, but
        guaranteeing the integrity of the audit log and the database state is still difficult. A transaction

        It would be interesting to use cryptographic tools to prove the integrity of a system in a way that
        is robust to a wide range of hardware and software issues, and even potentially malicious actions.
        Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum,
        Ripple, Stellar, and various others

        have sprung up to explore this area.</p>
        
        <p>I am not qualified to comment on the merits of these technologies as currencies or mechanisms for
        agreeing contracts. However, from a data systems point of view they contain some interesting ideas.
        Essentially, they are distributed databases, with a data model and transaction mechanism, in which
        different replicas can be hosted by mutually untrusting organizations. The replicas continually
        check each other’s integrity and use a consensus protocol to agree on the transactions that should
        be executed.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="correctness" data-secondary="Byzantine fault tolerance" id="idm45085098654688"></a>
        I am somewhat skeptical about the Byzantine fault tolerance aspects of these technologies (see
        <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#sec_distributed_byzantine">“Byzantine Faults”</a>), and I find the technique of <em>proof of work</em> (e.g., Bitcoin mining)
        extraordinarily wasteful. The transaction throughput of Bitcoin is rather low, albeit for political
        and economic reasons more than for technical ones. However, the integrity checking aspects are
        interesting.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Merkle trees" id="idm45085098651728"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="certificate transparency" id="idm45085098650672"></a>
        Cryptographic auditing and integrity checking often relies on <em>Merkle trees</em>
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Merkle1987jk-marker" href="ch12.html#Merkle1987jk">74</a>],
        which are trees of hashes that can be used to efficiently prove that a record appears in some
        dataset (and a few other things). Outside of the hype of cryptocurrencies, <em>certificate
        transparency</em> is a security technology that relies on Merkle trees to check the validity of TLS/SSL
        certificates [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Laurie2014kr-marker" href="ch12.html#Laurie2014kr">75</a>,

        <p>I could imagine integrity-checking and auditing algorithms, like those of certificate transparency
        and distributed ledgers, becoming more widely used in data systems in general. Some work will be
        needed to make them equally scalable as systems without cryptographic auditing, and to keep the
        performance penalty as low as possible. But I think this is an interesting area to watch in the future.

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" id="ix_ethics"></a>
        In the final section of this book, I would like to take a step back. Throughout this book we have
        examined a wide range of different architectures for data systems, evaluated their pros and cons,
        and explored techniques for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. However, we
        have left out an important and fundamental part of the discussion, which I would now like to fill
        in.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="unintended consequences" id="idm45085098629664"></a>
        Every system is built for a purpose; every action we take has both intended and unintended
        consequences. The purpose may be as simple as making money, but the consequences for the world may
        reach far beyond that original purpose. We, the engineers building these systems, have a
        responsibility to carefully consider those consequences and to consciously decide what kind of world
        we want to live in.</p>
        
        <p>We talk about data as an abstract thing, but remember that many datasets are about people: their
        behavior, their interests, their identity. We must treat such data with humanity and respect. Users
        are humans too, and human dignity is paramount.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="code of ethics and professional practice" id="idm45085098627216"></a>
        Software development increasingly involves making important ethical choices. There are guidelines to
        help software engineers navigate these issues, such as the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="ACMEthics-marker" href="ch12.html#ACMEthics">77</a>],
        but they are rarely discussed, applied, and enforced in practice. As a result, engineers and product
        managers sometimes take a very cavalier attitude to privacy and potential negative consequences of
        their products [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Chollet2016bo-marker" href="ch12.html#Chollet2016bo">78</a>,

        <p>A technology is not good or bad in itself—what matters is how it is used and how it affects people.
        This is true for a software system like a search engine in much the same way as it is for a weapon
        like a gun. I think it is not sufficient for software engineers to focus exclusively on the
        technology and ignore its consequences: the ethical responsibility is ours to bear also. Reasoning
        about ethics is difficult, but it is too important to ignore.</p>

        For example, predictive analytics is a major part of the “Big Data” hype. Using data analysis to
        predict the weather, or the spread of diseases, is one thing
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Kugler2016hn-marker" href="ch12.html#Kugler2016hn">81</a>];
        it is another matter to predict whether a convict is likely to reoffend, whether an applicant for a
        loan is likely to default, or whether an insurance customer is likely to make expensive claims. The
        latter have a direct effect on individual people’s lives.</p>
        
        <p>Naturally, payment networks want to prevent fraudulent transactions, banks want to avoid bad loans,
        airlines want to avoid hijackings, and companies want to avoid hiring ineffective or untrustworthy
        people. From their point of view, the cost of a missed business opportunity is low, but the cost of
        a bad loan or a problematic employee is much higher, so it is natural for organizations to want to
        be cautious. If in doubt, they are better off saying no.</p>
        
        <p>However, as algorithmic decision-making becomes more widespread, someone who has (accurately or
        falsely) been labeled as risky by some algorithm may suffer a large number of those “no” decisions.
        Systematically being excluded from jobs, air travel, insurance coverage, property rental, financial
        services, and other key aspects of society is such a large constraint of the individual’s freedom
        that it has been called “algorithmic prison”

        In countries that respect human rights, the criminal justice system presumes innocence until proven
        guilty; on the other hand, automated systems can systematically and arbitrarily exclude a person
        from participating in society without any proof of guilt, and with little chance of appeal.</p>

        <h3>Bias and discrimination</h3>
        
        <p>Decisions made by an algorithm are not necessarily any better or any worse than those made by a
        human. Every person is likely to have biases, even if they actively try to counteract them, and
        discriminatory practices can become culturally institutionalized. There is hope that basing
        decisions on data, rather than subjective and instinctive assessments by people, could be more fair
        and give a better chance to people who are often overlooked in the traditional system

        When we develop predictive analytics systems, we are not merely automating a human’s decision by
        using software to specify the rules for when to say yes or no; we are even leaving the rules
        themselves to be inferred from data. However, the patterns learned by these systems are opaque: even
        if there is some correlation in the data, we may not know why. If there is a systematic bias in the
        input to an algorithm, the system will most likely learn and amplify that bias in its output
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Alexander2016xa-marker" href="ch12.html#Alexander2016xa">84</a>].</p>

        In many countries, anti-discrimination laws prohibit treating people differently depending on
        protected traits such as ethnicity, age, gender, sexuality, disability, or beliefs. Other features
        of a person’s data may be analyzed, but what happens if they are correlated with protected traits?
        For example, in racially segregated neighborhoods, a person’s postal code or even their IP address
        is a strong predictor of race. Put like this, it seems ridiculous to believe that an algorithm could
        somehow take biased data as input and produce fair and impartial output from it

        often seems to be implied by proponents of data-driven decision making, an attitude that has been
        satirized as “machine learning is like money laundering for bias”

        Automated decision making opens the question of responsibility and accountability
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#ONeil2016vh">87</a>]. If a human makes a mistake, they can be
        held accountable, and the person affected by the decision can appeal. Algorithms make mistakes too,
        but who is accountable if they go wrong

        causes an accident, who is responsible? If an automated credit scoring algorithm systematically
        discriminates against people of a particular race or religion, is there any recourse? If a decision
        by your machine learning system comes under judicial review, can you explain to the judge how the
        algorithm made its decision?</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="credit rating agencies" id="idm45085098571072"></a>
        Credit rating agencies are an old example of collecting data to make decisions about people. A bad
        credit score makes life difficult, but at least a credit score is normally based on relevant facts
        about a person’s actual borrowing history, and any errors in the record can be corrected (although
        the agencies normally do not make this easy). However, scoring algorithms based on machine learning
        typically use a much wider range of inputs and are much more opaque, making it harder to understand
        how a particular decision has come about and whether someone is being treated in an unfair or
        discriminatory way [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Goodman2016vd-marker" href="ch12.html#Goodman2016vd">89</a>].</p>
        
        <p>A credit score summarizes “How did you behave in the past?” whereas predictive analytics usually
        work on the basis of “Who is similar to you, and how did people like you behave in the past?”
        Drawing parallels to others’ behavior implies stereotyping people, for example based on where they
        live (a close proxy for race and socioeconomic class). What about people who get put in the wrong
        bucket? Furthermore, if a decision is incorrect due to erroneous data, recourse is almost impossible
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#ONeil2016vh">87</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Much data is statistical in nature, which means that even if the probability distribution on the
        whole is correct, individual cases may well be wrong. For example, if the average life expectancy in
        your country is 80 years, that doesn’t mean you’re expected to drop dead on your 80th birthday.
        From the average and the probability distribution, you can’t say much about the age to which one
        particular person will live. Similarly, the output of a prediction system is probabilistic and may
        well be wrong in individual cases.</p>
        
        <p>A blind belief in the supremacy of data for making decisions is not only delusional, it is
        positively dangerous. As data-driven decision making becomes more widespread, we will need to figure
        out how to make algorithms accountable and transparent, how to avoid reinforcing existing biases,
        and how to fix them when they inevitably make mistakes.</p>
        
        <p>We will also need to figure out how to prevent data being used to harm people, and realize its
        positive potential instead. For example, analytics can reveal financial and social characteristics
        of people’s lives. On the one hand, this power could be used to focus aid and support to help those
        people who most need it. On the other hand, it is sometimes used by predatory business seeking to
        identify vulnerable people and sell them risky products such as high-cost loans and worthless

        Even with predictive applications that have less immediately far-reaching effects on people, such as
        recommendation systems, there are difficult issues that we must confront. When services become good
        at predicting what content users want to see, they may end up showing people only opinions they
        already agree with, leading to echo chambers in which stereotypes, misinformation, and polarization
        can breed. We are already seeing the impact of social media echo chambers on election campaigns

        <p>When predictive analytics affect people’s lives, particularly pernicious problems arise due to
        self-reinforcing feedback loops. For example, consider the case of employers using credit scores to
        evaluate potential hires. You may be a good worker with a good credit score, but suddenly find
        yourself in financial difficulties due to a misfortune outside of your control. As you miss payments
        on your bills, your credit score suffers, and you will be less likely to find work. Joblessness
        pushes you toward poverty, which further worsens your scores, making it even harder to find
        employment [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#ONeil2016vh">87</a>]. It’s a downward spiral due to
        poisonous assumptions, hidden behind a camouflage of mathematical rigor and data.</p>

        We can’t always predict when such feedback loops happen. However, many consequences can be predicted
        by thinking about the entire system (not just the computerized parts, but also the people
        interacting with it)—an approach known as <em>systems thinking</em>

        We can try to understand how a data analysis system responds to different behaviors, structures, or
        characteristics. Does the system reinforce and amplify existing differences between people (e.g.,
        making the rich richer or the poor poorer), or does it try to combat injustice? And even with the
        best intentions, we must beware of unintended consequences.

        Besides the problems of predictive analytics—i.e., using data to make automated decisions about
        people—there are ethical problems with data collection itself. What is the relationship between the
        organizations collecting data and the people whose data is being collected?</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tracking behavioral data" data-seealso="privacy" id="idm45085098537360"></a>
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="tracking behavioral data" id="idm45085098536288"></a>
        When a system only stores data that a user has explicitly entered, because they want the system to
        store and process it in a certain way, the system is performing a service for the user: the user is
        the customer. But when a user’s activity is tracked and logged as a side effect of other things they
        are doing, the relationship is less clear. The service no longer just does what the user tells it to
        do, but it takes on interests of its own, which may conflict with the user’s interests.</p>
        
        <p>Tracking behavioral data has become increasingly important for user-facing features of many online
        services: tracking which search results are clicked helps improve the ranking of search results;
        recommending “people who liked X also liked Y” helps users discover interesting and useful things;
        A/B tests and user flow analysis can help indicate how a user interface might be improved. Those
        features require some amount of tracking of user behavior, and users benefit from them.</p>
        
        <p>However, depending on a company’s business model, tracking often doesn’t stop there. If the service
        is funded through advertising, the advertisers are the actual customers, and the users’ interests
        take second place. Tracking data becomes more detailed, analyses become further-reaching, and data
        is retained for a long time in order to build up detailed profiles of each person for marketing
        purposes.</p>
        
        <p>Now the relationship between the company and the user whose data is being collected starts looking
        quite different. The user is given a free service and is coaxed into engaging with it as much as
        possible. The tracking of the user serves not primarily that individual, but rather the needs of
        the advertisers who are funding the service. I think this relationship can be appropriately
        described with a word that has more sinister connotations: <em>surveillance</em>.</p>

        As a thought experiment, try replacing the word <em>data</em> with <em>surveillance</em>, and observe if common
        phrases still sound so good
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Bernstein2015bp-marker" href="ch12.html#Bernstein2015bp">93</a>].
        How about this: “In our surveillance-driven organization we collect real-time surveillance streams
        and store them in our surveillance warehouse. Our surveillance scientists use advanced analytics and
        surveillance processing in order to derive new insights.”</p>
        
        <p>This thought experiment is unusually polemic for this book, <em>Designing Surveillance-Intensive
        Applications</em>, but I think that strong words are needed to emphasize this point. In our attempts to
        make software “eat the world”
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Andreessen2011xa-marker" href="ch12.html#Andreessen2011xa">94</a>], we have built
        the greatest mass surveillance infrastructure the world has ever seen. Rushing toward an Internet
        of Things, we are rapidly approaching a world in which every inhabited space contains at least one
        internet-connected microphone, in the form of smartphones, smart TVs, voice-controlled assistant
        devices, baby monitors, and even children’s toys that use cloud-based speech recognition. Many of
        these devices have a terrible security record [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Porup2016cx-marker" href="ch12.html#Porup2016cx">95</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Even the most totalitarian and repressive regimes could only dream of putting a microphone in every
        room and forcing every person to constantly carry a device capable of tracking their location and
        movements.  Yet we apparently voluntarily, even enthusiastically, throw ourselves into this world of
        total surveillance. The difference is just that the data is being collected by corporations rather
        than government agencies [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Schneier2015vf-marker" href="ch12.html#Schneier2015vf">96</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Not all data collection necessarily qualifies as surveillance, but examining it as such can help us
        understand our relationship with the data collector. Why are we seemingly happy to accept
        surveillance by corporations? Perhaps you feel you have nothing to hide—in other words, you are
        totally in line with existing power structures, you are not a marginalized minority, and you needn’t
        fear persecution [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Grugq2016nw-marker" href="ch12.html#Grugq2016nw">97</a>]. Not everyone is so fortunate. Or perhaps it’s
        because the purpose seems benign—it’s not overt coercion and conformance, but merely better
        recommendations and more personalized marketing. However, combined with the discussion of predictive
        analytics from the last section, that distinction seems less clear.</p>
        
        <p>We are already seeing car insurance premiums linked to tracking devices in cars, and health
        insurance coverage that depends on people wearing a fitness tracking device. When surveillance is
        used to determine things that hold sway over important aspects of life, such as insurance coverage
        or employment, it starts to appear less benign. Moreover, data analysis can reveal surprisingly
        intrusive things: for example, the movement sensor in a smartwatch or fitness tracker can be used to
        work out what you are typing (for example, passwords) with fairly good accuracy
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Beltramelli2015wk-marker" href="ch12.html#Beltramelli2015wk">98</a>]. And algorithms for analysis are only going to get better.</p>

        <h3>Consent and freedom of choice</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="privacy" data-secondary="consent and freedom of choice" id="idm45085098506256"></a>

        We might assert that users voluntarily choose to use a service that tracks their activity, and they
        have agreed to the terms of service and privacy policy, so they consent to data collection. We might
        even claim that users are receiving a valuable service in return for the data they provide, and that
        the tracking is necessary in order to provide the service. Undoubtedly, social networks, search
        engines, and various other free online services are valuable to users—but there are problems with
        this argument.</p>
        
        <p>Users have little knowledge of what data they are feeding into our databases, or how it is retained
        and processed—and most privacy policies do more to obscure than to illuminate. Without understanding
        what happens to their data, users cannot give any meaningful consent. Often, data from one user also
        says things about other people who are not users of the service and who have not agreed to any
        terms. The derived datasets that we discussed in this part of the book—in which data from the entire
        user base may have been combined with behavioral tracking and external data sources—are precisely
        the kinds of data of which users cannot have any meaningful understanding.</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, data is extracted from users through a one-way process, not a relationship with true
        reciprocity, and not a fair value exchange. There is no dialog, no option for users to negotiate how
        much data they provide and what service they receive in return: the relationship between the service
        and the user is very asymmetric and one-sided. The terms are set by the service, not by the user
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Zuboff2015jd-marker" href="ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd">99</a>].</p>
        
        <p>For a user who does not consent to surveillance, the only real alternative is simply not to use a
        service. But this choice is not free either: if a service is so popular that it is “regarded by most
        people as essential for basic social participation”
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd">99</a>], then it is not reasonable to expect
        people to opt out of this service—using it is <em>de facto</em> mandatory. For example, in most Western
        social communities, it has become the norm to carry a smartphone, to use Facebook for socializing,
        and to use Google for finding information. Especially when a service has network effects, there is a
        social cost to people choosing <em>not</em> to use it.</p>
        
        <p>Declining to use a service due to its tracking of users is only an option for the small number of
        people who are privileged enough to have the time and knowledge to understand its privacy policy,
        and who can afford to potentially miss out on social participation or professional opportunities
        that may have arisen if they had participated in the service. For people in a less privileged
        position, there is no meaningful freedom of choice: surveillance becomes inescapable.</p>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="privacy and tracking" data-tertiary="meaning of privacy" id="idm45085098492256"></a>
        Sometimes people claim that “privacy is dead” on the grounds that some users are willing to post all
        sorts of things about their lives to social media, sometimes mundane and sometimes deeply personal.
        However, this claim is false and rests on a misunderstanding of the word <em>privacy</em>.</p>
        
        <p>Having privacy does not mean keeping everything secret; it means having the freedom to choose which
        things to reveal to whom, what to make public, and what to keep secret. The right to privacy is a
        decision right: it enables each person to decide where they want to be on the spectrum between
        secrecy and transparency in each situation [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd">99</a>].
        It is an important aspect of a person’s freedom and autonomy.</p>
        
        <p>When data is extracted from people through surveillance infrastructure, privacy rights are not
        necessarily eroded, but rather transferred to the data collector. Companies that acquire data
        essentially say “trust us to do the right thing with your data,” which means that the right to
        decide what to reveal and what to keep secret is transferred from the individual to the company.</p>
        
        <p>The companies in turn choose to keep much of the outcome of this surveillance secret, because to
        reveal it would be perceived as creepy, and would harm their business model (which relies on knowing
        more about people than other companies do). Intimate information about users is only revealed
        indirectly, for example in the form of tools for targeting advertisements to specific groups of
        people (such as those suffering from a particular illness).</p>
        
        <p>Even if particular users cannot be personally reidentified from the bucket of people targeted by a
        particular ad, they have lost their agency about the disclosure of some intimate information, such
        as whether they suffer from some illness. It is not the user who decides what is revealed to whom on
        the basis of their personal preferences—it is the company that exercises the privacy right with
        the goal of maximizing its profit.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="correctness" data-secondary="of personal data" id="idm45085098485680"></a>
        Many companies have a goal of not being <em>perceived</em> as creepy—avoiding the question of how
        intrusive their data collection actually is, and instead focusing on managing user perceptions. And
        even these perceptions are often managed poorly: for example, something may be factually correct,
        but if it triggers painful memories, the user may not want to be reminded about it
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Zona2016nj-marker" href="ch12.html#Zona2016nj">100</a>].
        With any kind of data we should expect the possibility that it is wrong, undesirable, or
        inappropriate in some way, and we need to build mechanisms for handling those failures. Whether
        something is “undesirable” or “inappropriate” is of course down to human judgment; algorithms are
        oblivious to such notions unless we explicitly program them to respect human needs. As engineers of
        these systems we must be humble, accepting and planning for such failings.</p>
        
        <p>Privacy settings that allow a user of an online service to control which aspects of their data other
        users can see are a starting point for handing back some control to users. However, regardless of
        the setting, the service itself still has unfettered access to the data, and is free to use it in
        any way permitted by the privacy policy. Even if the service promises not to sell the data to third
        parties, it usually grants itself unrestricted rights to process and analyze the data internally,
        often going much further than what is overtly visible to users.</p>
        
        <p>This kind of large-scale transfer of privacy rights from individuals to corporations is historically
        unprecedented [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd">99</a>]. Surveillance has always
        existed, but it used to be expensive and manual, not scalable and automated. Trust relationships
        have always existed, for example between a patient and their doctor, or between a defendant and
        their attorney—but in these cases the use of data has been strictly governed by ethical, legal,
        and regulatory constraints. Internet services have made it much easier to amass huge amounts of
        sensitive information without meaningful consent, and to use it at
        massive scale without users understanding what is happening to their private data.</p>

        Since behavioral data is a byproduct of users interacting with a service, it is sometimes called
        “data exhaust”—suggesting that the data is worthless waste material. Viewed this way, behavioral
        and predictive analytics can be seen as a form of recycling that extracts value from data that would
        have otherwise been thrown away.</p>
        
        <p>More correct would be to view it the other way round: from an economic point of view, if targeted
        advertising is what pays for a service, then behavioral data about people is the service’s core
        asset. In this case, the application with which the user interacts is merely a
        means to lure users into feeding more and more personal information into the surveillance
        infrastructure [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd">99</a>]. The delightful human
        creativity and social relationships that often find expression in online services are cynically
        exploited by the data extraction machine.</p>
        
        <p>The assertion that personal data is a valuable asset is supported by the existence of data brokers,
        a shady industry operating in secrecy, purchasing, aggregating, analyzing, inferring, and reselling
        intrusive personal data about people, mostly for marketing purposes
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#USSenate2013um">90</a>].
        Startups are valued by their user numbers, by “eyeballs”—i.e., by their surveillance capabilities.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="government use of data" id="idm45085098470080"></a>
        Because the data is valuable, many people want it. Of course companies want it—that’s why they
        collect it in the first place. But governments want to obtain it too: by means of secret deals,
        coercion, legal compulsion, or simply stealing it
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Schneier2016tf-marker" href="ch12.html#Schneier2016tf">101</a>].
        When a company goes bankrupt, the personal data it has collected is one of the assets that get sold.
        Moreover, the data is difficult to secure, so breaches happen disconcertingly often
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Dunn2016gy-marker" href="ch12.html#Dunn2016gy">102</a>].</p>
        
        <p>These observations have led critics to saying that data is not just an asset, but a “toxic asset”
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Schneier2016tf">101</a>], or at least “hazardous material”
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Scott2016cq-marker" href="ch12.html#Scott2016cq">103</a>]. Even if we think that we are capable of preventing
        abuse of data, whenever we collect data, we need to balance the benefits with the risk of it falling
        into the wrong hands: computer systems may be compromised by criminals or hostile foreign
        intelligence services, data may be leaked by insiders, the company may fall into the hands of
        unscrupulous management that does not share our values, or the country may be taken over by a regime
        that has no qualms about compelling us to hand over the data.</p>
        
        <p>When collecting data, we need to consider not just today’s political environment, but all possible
        future governments. There is no guarantee that every government elected in future will respect human
        rights and civil liberties, so “it is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday
        facilitate a police state” [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Schneier2013qj-marker" href="ch12.html#Schneier2013qj">104</a>].</p>
        
        <p>“Knowledge is power,” as the old adage goes. And furthermore, “to scrutinize others while avoiding
        scrutiny oneself is one of the most important forms of power”

        This is why totalitarian governments want surveillance: it gives them the power to control the
        population. Although today’s technology companies are not overtly seeking political power, the data
        and knowledge they have accumulated nevertheless gives them a lot of power over our lives, much of
        which is surreptitious, outside of public oversight

        <h3>Remembering the Industrial Revolution</h3>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Industrial Revolution" id="idm45085098449632"></a>
        Data is the defining feature of the information age. The internet, data storage, processing, and
        software-driven automation are having a major impact on the global economy and human society. As our daily lives
        and social organization have changed in the past decade, and will probably continue to radically
        change in the coming decades, comparisons to the Industrial Revolution come to mind
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#ONeil2016vh">87</a>,
        <a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Schneier2015vf">96</a>].</p>
        
        <p>The Industrial Revolution came about through major technological and agricultural advances, and it
        brought sustained economic growth and significantly improved living standards in the long run. Yet
        it also came with major problems: pollution of the air (due to smoke and chemical processes) and the
        water (from industrial and human waste) was dreadful. Factory owners lived in splendor, while urban
        workers often lived in very poor housing and worked long hours in harsh conditions. Child labor was
        common, including dangerous and poorly paid work in mines.</p>
        
        <p>It took a long time before safeguards were established, such as environmental protection
        regulations, safety protocols for workplaces, outlawing child labor, and health inspections for
        food. Undoubtedly the cost of doing business increased when factories were no longer allowed to dump their
        waste into rivers, sell tainted foods, or exploit workers. But society as a whole benefited hugely
        from these regulations, and few of us would want to return to a time before
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#ONeil2016vh">87</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Just as the Industrial Revolution had a dark side that needed to be managed, our transition to the
        information age has major problems that we need to confront and solve. I believe that the collection
        and use of data is one of those problems. In the words of Bruce Schneier
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Schneier2015vf">96</a>]:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Data is the pollution problem of the information age, and protecting privacy is the environmental
        challenge. Almost all computers produce information. It stays around, festering. How we deal with
        it—how we contain it and how we dispose of it—is central to the health of our information
        economy. Just as we look back today at the early decades of the industrial age and wonder how our
        ancestors could have ignored pollution in their rush to build an industrial world, our grandchildren
        will look back at us during these early decades of the information age and judge us on how we
        addressed the challenge of data collection and misuse.</p>
        
        <p>We should try to make them proud.</p></blockquote>

        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data protection regulations" id="idm45085098436736"></a>
        Data protection laws might be able to help preserve individuals’ rights. For example, the 1995
        European Data Protection Directive states that personal data must be “collected for specified,
        explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those
        purposes,” and furthermore that data must be “adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to
        the purposes for which they are collected”
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="DataProtectionDirective1995-marker" href="ch12.html#DataProtectionDirective1995">107</a>].</p>
        
        <p>However, it is doubtful whether this legislation is effective in today’s internet context
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="VanAlsenoy2016wb-marker" href="ch12.html#VanAlsenoy2016wb">108</a>]. These rules run directly counter
        to the philosophy of Big Data, which is to maximize data collection, to combine it with other
        datasets, to experiment and to explore in order to generate new insights. Exploration means using
        data for unforeseen purposes, which is the opposite of the “specified and explicit” purposes for
        which the user gave their consent (if we can meaningfully speak of consent at all
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Rhoen2016ff-marker" href="ch12.html#Rhoen2016ff">109</a>]). Updated
        regulations are now being developed [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Goodman2016vd">89</a>].</p>
        
        <p>Companies that collect lots of data about people oppose regulation as being a burden and a hindrance
        to innovation. To some extent that opposition is justified. For example, when sharing medical data,
        there are clear risks to privacy, but there are also potential opportunities: how many deaths could
        be prevented if data analysis was able to help us achieve better diagnostics or find better
        treatments [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Leber2016xy-marker" href="ch12.html#Leber2016xy">110</a>]? Over-regulation may prevent such breakthroughs. It is difficult to balance such
        potential opportunities with the risks [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Ulbricht2016gh">105</a>].</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="respect, dignity, and agency" id="idm45085098422144"></a>
        Fundamentally, I think we need a culture shift in the tech industry with regard to personal data. We
        should stop regarding users as metrics to be optimized, and remember that they are humans who
        deserve respect, dignity, and agency. We should self-regulate our data collection and processing
        practices in order to establish and maintain the trust of the people who depend on our software
        [<a xmlns:htmlbook="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-type="noteref" id="Ceglowski2015vw-marker" href="ch12.html#Ceglowski2015vw">111</a>]. And we should take it upon ourselves to educate end users about how their
        data is used, rather than keeping them in the dark.</p>
        
        <p>We should allow each individual to maintain their privacy—i.e., their control over own data—and not
        steal that control from them through surveillance. Our individual right to control our data is like
        the natural environment of a national park: if we don’t explicitly protect and care for it, it will
        be destroyed. It will be the tragedy of the commons, and we will all be worse off for it. Ubiquitous
        surveillance is not inevitable—we are still able to stop it.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cryptography" data-secondary="end-to-end encryption and authentication" id="idm45085098417104"></a>
        How exactly we might achieve this is an open question. To begin with, we should not retain data
        forever, but purge it as soon as it is no longer needed
        [<a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#Ceglowski2015vw">111</a>,

        <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability_limitations">“Limitations of immutability”</a>), but that issue can be solved. A promising approach I see
        is to enforce access control through cryptographic protocols, rather than merely by policy

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data integration" id="idm45085098402752"></a>
        In this chapter we discussed new approaches to designing data systems, and I included my personal
        opinions and speculations about the future. We started with the observation that there is no one
        single tool that can efficiently serve all possible use cases, and so applications necessarily need
        to compose several different pieces of software to accomplish their goals. We discussed how to solve
        this <em>data integration</em> problem by using batch processing and event streams to let data changes flow
        between different systems.</p>
        
        <p>In this approach, certain systems are designated as systems of record, and other data is derived
        from them through transformations. In this way we can maintain indexes, materialized views, machine
        learning models, statistical summaries, and more. By making these derivations and transformations
        asynchronous and loosely coupled, a problem in one area is prevented from spreading to unrelated
        parts of the system, increasing the robustness and fault-tolerance of the system as a whole.</p>
        
        <p>Expressing dataflows as transformations from one dataset to another also helps evolve applications:
        if you want to change one of the processing steps, for example to change the structure of an index
        or cache, you can just rerun the new transformation code on the whole input dataset in order to
        rederive the output. Similarly, if something goes wrong, you can fix the code and reprocess the
        data in order to recover.</p>
        
        <p>These processes are quite similar to what databases already do internally, so we recast the idea of
        dataflow applications as <em>unbundling</em> the components of a database, and building an application by
        composing these loosely coupled components.</p>
        
        <p>Derived state can be updated by observing changes in the underlying data. Moreover, the derived
        state itself can further be observed by downstream consumers. We can even take this dataflow all the
        way through to the end-user device that is displaying the data, and thus build user interfaces that
        dynamically update to reflect data changes and continue to work offline.</p>
        
        <p>Next, we discussed how to ensure that all of this processing remains correct in the presence of
        faults. We saw that strong integrity guarantees can be implemented scalably with asynchronous event
        processing, by using end-to-end request identifiers to make operations idempotent and by checking
        constraints asynchronously. Clients can either wait until the check has passed, or go ahead without
        waiting but risk having to apologize about a constraint violation. This approach is much more
        scalable and robust than the traditional approach of using distributed transactions, and fits with
        how many business processes work in practice.</p>
        
        <p>By structuring applications around dataflow and checking constraints asynchronously, we can avoid
        most coordination and create systems that maintain integrity but still perform well, even in
        geographically distributed scenarios and in the presence of faults. We then talked a little about
        using audits to verify the integrity of data and detect corruption.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we took a step back and examined some ethical aspects of building data-intensive
        applications. We saw that although data can be used to do good, it can also do significant harm:
        making decisions that seriously affect people’s lives and are difficult to appeal
        against, leading to discrimination and exploitation, normalizing surveillance, and exposing intimate
        information. We also run the risk of data breaches, and we may find that a well-intentioned use of
        data has unintended consequences.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ethics" data-secondary="respect, dignity, and agency" id="idm45085098394240"></a>
        As software and data are having such a large impact on the world, we engineers must remember that we
        carry a responsibility to work toward the kind of world that we want to live in: a world that treats
        people with humanity and respect. I hope that we can work together toward that goal.
