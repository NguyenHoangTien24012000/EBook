        <p>Successful<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="working definition of" data-type="indexterm" id="DAworkdef03"></a> data engineering is built upon rock-solid data architecture. This chapter aims to review a few popular architecture approaches and frameworks, and then craft our opinionated definition of what makes “good” data architecture. Indeed, we won’t make everyone happy. Still, we will lay out a pragmatic, domain-specific, working definition for <em>data architecture</em> that we think will work for companies of vastly different scales, business processes, and needs.</p>
        
        <p>What is data architecture? When you stop to unpack it, the topic becomes a bit murky; researching data architecture yields many inconsistent and often outdated definitions. It’s a lot like when we defined <em>data engineering</em> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#data_engineering_described">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>—there’s no consensus. In a field that is constantly changing, this is to be expected. So what do we mean by <em>data architecture</em> for the purposes of this book? Before defining the term, it’s essential to understand the context in which it sits. Let’s briefly cover enterprise architecture, which will frame our definition of data architecture.</p>

        <h3>Our definition</h3>
        
        <p>We extract a few common threads in these definitions of enterprise architecture: change, alignment, organization, opportunities, problem-solving, and migration. Here is our definition of <em>enterprise architecture</em>, one that we feel is more relevant to today’s fast-moving data landscape:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Enterprise architecture is the design of systems to support <em>change in the enterprise</em>, achieved by <em>flexible and reversible decisions</em> reached through careful <em>evaluation of trade-offs</em>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Here, we touch on some key areas we’ll return to throughout the book: flexible and reversible decisions, change management, and evaluation of trade-offs. We discuss each theme at length in this section and then make the definition more concrete in the latter part of the chapter by giving various examples of data architecture.</p>
        
        <p>Flexible and reversible decisions are essential for two reasons. First, the world is constantly changing, and predicting the future is impossible. Reversible decisions allow you to adjust course as the world changes and you gather new information. Second, there is a natural tendency toward enterprise ossification as organizations grow. Adopting a culture of reversible decisions helps overcome this tendency by reducing the risk attached to a decision.</p>
        
        <p>Jeff Bezos is credited with the idea of one-way and two-way doors.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn20-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn20">4</a></sup> A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="one-way doors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133544080"></a> <em>one-way door</em> is a decision that is almost impossible to reverse. For example, Amazon could have decided to sell AWS or shut it down. It would be nearly impossible for Amazon to rebuild a public cloud with the same market position after such an action.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="two-way doors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133541728"></a> <em>two-way door</em> is an easily reversible decision: you walk through and proceed if you like what you see in the room or step back through the door if you don’t. Amazon might decide to require the use of DynamoDB for a new microservices database. If this policy doesn’t work, Amazon has the option of reversing it and refactoring some services to use other databases. Since the stakes attached to each reversible decision (two-way door) are low, organizations can make more decisions, iterating, improving, and collecting data rapidly.</p>
        
        <p>Change management is closely related to reversible decisions and is a central theme of enterprise architecture frameworks. Even with an emphasis on reversible decisions, enterprises often need to undertake large initiatives. These are ideally broken into smaller changes, each one a reversible decision in itself. Returning to Amazon, we note a five-year gap (2007 to 2012) from the publication of a paper on the DynamoDB concept to Werner Vogels’s announcement of the DynamoDB service on AWS. Behind the scenes, teams took numerous small actions to make DynamoDB a concrete reality for AWS customers. Managing such small actions is at the heart of change management.</p>
        
        <p>Architects are not simply mapping out IT processes and vaguely looking toward a distant, utopian future; they actively solve business problems and create new opportunities. Technical solutions exist not for their own sake but in support of business goals. Architects identify problems in the current state (poor data quality, scalability limits, money-losing lines of business), define desired future states (agile data-quality improvement, scalable cloud data solutions, improved business processes), and realize initiatives through execution of small, concrete steps. It bears repeating:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Technical solutions exist not for their own sake but in support of business goals.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>We found significant inspiration in <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/hpCp0"><em>Fundamentals of Software Architecture</em></a> by Mark Richards and Neal Ford (O’Reilly). They emphasize that trade-offs are inevitable and ubiquitous in the engineering space. Sometimes the relatively fluid nature of software and data leads us to believe that we are freed from the constraints that engineers face in the hard, cold physical world. Indeed, this is partially true; patching a software bug is much easier than redesigning and replacing an airplane wing. However, digital systems are ultimately constrained by physical limits such as latency, reliability, density, and energy consumption. Engineers also confront various nonphysical limits, such as characteristics of programming languages and frameworks, and practical constraints in managing complexity, budgets, etc. Magical thinking culminates in poor engineering. Data engineers must account for trade-offs at every step to design an optimal system while minimizing high-interest technical debt.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s reiterate one central point in our enterprise architecture definition: enterprise architecture balances flexibility and trade-offs. This isn’t always an easy balance, and architects must constantly assess and reevaluate with the recognition that the world is dynamic. Given the pace of change that enterprises are faced with, organizations—and their architecture—cannot afford to stand still.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="eaentarch03" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133535152"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-startref="entarch03" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133533808"></a></p>

        <p>Now that you understand enterprise architecture, let’s dive into data architecture by establishing a working definition that will set the stage for the rest of the book. <em>Data architecture</em> is a subset of enterprise architecture, inheriting its properties: processes, strategy, change management, and evaluating trade-offs.

        <h3>Our definition</h3>
        
        <p>Considering the preceding two definitions and our experience, we have crafted our definition of <em>data architecture</em>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Data architecture is the design of systems to support the evolving data needs of an enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisions reached through a careful evaluation of trade-offs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>How does data architecture fit into data engineering? Just as the data engineering lifecycle is a subset of the data lifecycle, data engineering architecture is a subset of general data architecture. <em>Data engineering architecture</em> is the systems and <span class="keep-together">frameworks</span> that make up the key sections of the data engineering lifecycle. We’ll use <em>data architecture</em> interchangeably with <em>data engineering architecture</em> throughout this book.</p>
        
        <p>Other<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="operational architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133509424"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="technical architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133508272"></a> aspects of data architecture that you should be aware of are operational and technical (<a data-type="xref" href="#operational_and_technical_data_architec">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a>). <em>Operational architecture</em> encompasses the functional requirements of what needs to happen related to people, processes, and technology. For example, what business processes does the data serve? How does the organization manage data quality? What is the latency requirement from when the data is produced to when it becomes available to query? <em>Technical architecture</em> outlines how data is ingested, stored, transformed, and served along the data engineering lifecycle. For instance, how will you move 10 TB of data every hour from a source database to your data lake? In short, operational architecture describes <em>what</em> needs to be done, and technical architecture details <em>how</em> it will happen.</p>

        <p>What do we mean by “good” data architecture? To paraphrase an old cliche, you know good when you see it. <em>Good data architecture</em> serves business requirements with a common, widely reusable set of building blocks while maintaining flexibility and making appropriate trade-offs. Bad architecture is authoritarian and tries to cram a bunch of one-size-fits-all decisions into a <a href="https://oreil.ly/YWfb1">big ball of mud</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Agility<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="agility" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133466032"></a> is the foundation for good data architecture; it acknowledges that the world is fluid. <em>Good data architecture is flexible and easily maintainable</em>. It evolves in response to changes within the business and new technologies and practices that may unlock even more value in the future. Businesses and their use cases for data are always evolving. The world is dynamic, and the pace of change in the data space is <span class="keep-together">accelerating.</span> Last year’s data architecture that served you well might not be sufficient for today, let alone next year.</p>
        
        <p>Bad data architecture is tightly coupled, rigid, overly centralized, or uses the wrong tools for the job, hampering development and change management. Ideally, by designing architecture with reversibility in mind, changes will be less costly.</p>
        
        <p>The undercurrents of the data engineering lifecycle form the foundation of good data architecture for companies at any stage of data maturity. Again, these undercurrents are security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.</p>
        
        <p>Good data architecture is a living, breathing thing. It’s never finished. In fact, per our definition, change and evolution are central to the meaning and purpose of data architecture. Let’s now look at the principles of good data architecture.</p>

        <p>One<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="principles of good data architecture" data-tertiary="choose common components wisely" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133424336"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="components, choosing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133422624"></a> of the primary jobs of a data engineer is to choose common components and practices that can be used widely across an organization. When architects choose well and lead effectively, common components become a fabric facilitating team collaboration and breaking down silos. Common components enable agility within and across teams in conjunction with shared knowledge and skills.</p>
        
        <p>Common components can be anything that has broad applicability within an organization. Common components include<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="selecting storage systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133420624"></a> object storage, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="version-control systems, selecting" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133419152"></a>version-control systems, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="observability" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133417872"></a>observability, <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="monitoring" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133416640"></a>monitoring and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="orchestration" data-secondary="choosing components wisely" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133415376"></a>orchestration systems, and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="processing engines, choosing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133413776"></a>processing engines. Common components should be accessible to everyone with an appropriate use case, and teams are encouraged to rely on common components already in use rather than reinventing the wheel. Common components must support robust permissions and security to enable sharing of assets among teams while preventing unauthorized access.</p>
        
        <p class="pagebreak-after">Cloud platforms<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud services" data-secondary="adopting common components" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133411552"></a> are an ideal place to adopt common components. For example, compute and storage separation in cloud data systems allows users to access a shared storage layer (most commonly object storage) using specialized tools to access and query the data needed for specific use cases.</p>
        
        <p>Choosing common components is a balancing act. On the one hand, you need to focus on needs across the data engineering lifecycle and teams, utilize common components that will be useful for individual projects, and simultaneously facilitate interoperation and collaboration. On the other hand, architects should avoid decisions that will hamper the productivity of engineers working on domain-specific problems by forcing them into<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="one-size-fits-all technology solutions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133408896"></a> one-size-fits-all technology solutions. <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#choosing_technologies_across_the_data_e">Chapter&nbsp;4</a> provides additional details.</p>

Even so, any hardware component will fail, given enough time. To build highly robust data systems, you must consider failures in your designs. Here are a few key terms for evaluating failure scenarios; we describe these in greater detail in this chapter and throughout the book:</p>

The recovery time objective (RTO) is generally set by determining the business impact of an outage. An RTO of one day might be fine for an internal reporting system. A website outage of just five minutes could have a significant adverse business impact on an online retailer.</p>

        <h2>Principle 3: Architect for Scalability</h2>
        
        <p>Scalability<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="principles of good data architecture" data-tertiary="architect for scalability" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135361952"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="architecting for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135360288"></a> in data systems encompasses two main capabilities. First, scalable systems can <em>scale up</em> to handle significant quantities of data. We might need to spin up a large cluster to train a model on a petabyte of customer data or scale out a streaming ingestion system to handle a transient load spike. Our ability to scale up allows us to handle extreme loads temporarily. Second, scalable systems can <em>scale down</em>. Once the load spike ebbs, we should automatically remove capacity to cut costs. (This is related to principle 9.) An<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="elastic systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135357504"></a> <em>elastic system</em> can scale dynamically in response to load, ideally in an automated fashion.</p>
        
        <p>Some scalable systems can also <em>scale to zero</em>: they shut down completely when not in use. Once the large model-training job completes, we can delete the cluster. Many serverless systems (e.g., serverless functions and serverless online analytical processing, or OLAP, databases) can automatically scale to zero.</p>
        
        <p>Note that deploying inappropriate scaling strategies can result in overcomplicated systems and high costs. A straightforward relational database with one failover node may be appropriate for an application instead of a complex cluster arrangement. Measure your current load, approximate load spikes, and estimate load over the next several years to determine if your database architecture is appropriate. If your startup grows much faster than anticipated, this growth should also lead to more available resources to rearchitect for scalability.</p>

        <h2>Principle 4: Architecture Is Leadership</h2>
        
        <p>Data architects<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="principles of good data architecture" data-tertiary="architecture is leadership" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135352512"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leadership, architecture as" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135350752"></a> are responsible for technology decisions and architecture descriptions and disseminating these choices through effective leadership and training. Data architects should be highly technically competent but delegate most individual contributor work to others. Strong leadership skills combined with high technical competence are rare and extremely valuable. The best data architects take this duality seriously.</p>
        
        <p>Note that leadership does not imply a command-and-control approach to technology. It was not uncommon in the past for architects to choose one proprietary database technology and force every team to house their data there. We oppose this approach because it can significantly hinder current data projects. Cloud environments allow architects to balance common component choices with flexibility that enables innovation within projects.</p>
        
        <p class="pagebreak-before">Returning to the notion of technical leadership, Martin Fowler describes a specific archetype of an ideal software architect, well embodied in his colleague Dave Rice:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn21-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn21">9</a></sup></p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>In many ways, the most important activity of <em>Architectus Oryzus</em> is to mentor the development team, to raise their level so they can take on more complex issues. Improving the development team’s ability gives an architect much greater leverage than being the sole decision-maker and thus running the risk of being an architectural bottleneck.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>An ideal data architect manifests similar characteristics. They possess the technical skills of a data engineer but no longer practice data engineering day to day; they mentor current data engineers, make careful technology choices in consultation with their organization, and disseminate expertise through training and leadership. They train engineers in best practices and bring the company’s engineering resources together to pursue common goals in both technology and business.</p>
        
        <p>As a data engineer, you should practice architecture leadership and seek mentorship from architects. Eventually, you may well occupy the architect role yourself.</p>

            <li>
            <p>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It doesn’t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols—doesn’t matter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The advent of Bezos’s API Mandate is widely viewed as a watershed moment for Amazon. Putting data and services behind APIs enabled the loose coupling and eventually resulted in AWS as we know it now. Google’s pursuit of loose coupling allowed it to grow its systems to an extraordinary scale.</p>
        
        <p>For software architecture, a loosely coupled system has the following properties:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p>Systems are broken into many small components.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>These systems interface with other services through abstraction layers, such as a messaging bus or an API. These abstraction layers hide and protect internal details of the service, such as a database backend or internal classes and method calls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>As a consequence of property 2, internal changes to a system component don’t require changes in other parts. Details of code updates are hidden behind stable APIs. Each piece can evolve and improve separately.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>As a consequence of property 3, there is no waterfall, global release cycle for the whole system. Instead, each component is updated separately as changes and improvements are made.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Notice that we are talking about <em>technical systems</em>. We need to think bigger. Let’s translate these technical characteristics into<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="organizational characteristics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133774496"></a> organizational characteristics:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p>Many small teams engineer a large, complex system. Each team is tasked with engineering, maintaining, and improving some system components.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>These teams publish the abstract details of their components to other teams via API definitions, message schemas, etc. Teams need not concern themselves with other teams’ components; they simply use the published API or message specifications to call these components. They iterate their part to improve their performance and capabilities over time. They might also publish new capabilities as they are added or request new stuff from other teams. Again, the latter happens without teams needing to worry about the internal technical details of the requested features. Teams work together through<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="loosely coupled communication" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133770560"></a> <em>loosely coupled communication</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>As a consequence of characteristic 2, each team can rapidly evolve and improve its component independently of the work of other teams.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Specifically, characteristic 3 implies that teams can release updates to their components with minimal downtime. Teams release continuously during regular working hours to make code changes and test them.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Loose coupling of both technology and human systems will allow your data engineering teams to more efficiently collaborate with one another and with other parts of the company. This principle also directly facilitates principle 7.</p>

Today’s hot technology or stack is tomorrow’s afterthought. Popular opinion shifts quickly. You should aim for reversible decisions, as these tend to simplify your architecture and keep it agile.</p>
        
        <p>As Fowler wrote, “One of an architect’s most important tasks is to remove architecture by finding ways to eliminate irreversibility in software designs.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn23-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn23">12</a></sup> What was true when Fowler wrote this in 2003 is just as accurate today.</p>
        
        <p>As we said previously, Bezos refers to reversible decisions as<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="one-way doors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133756768"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="two-way doors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133755584"></a> “two-way doors.” As he says, “If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that—they are changeable, reversible—they’re two-way doors.” Aim for two-way doors whenever possible.</p>
        
        <p>Given the pace of change—and the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="decoupling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133753888"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="modularization" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133752784"></a> decoupling/modularization of technologies across your data architecture—always strive to pick the best-of-breed solutions that work for today. Also, be prepared to upgrade or adopt better practices as the landscape evolves.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Traditional architectures place a lot of faith in perimeter security, crudely a hardened network perimeter with “trusted things” inside and “untrusted things” outside. Unfortunately, this approach has always been vulnerable to insider attacks, as well as external threats such as spear phishing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The 1996 film <em>Mission Impossible</em> presents a perfect example of the hard-perimeter security model and its limitations. In the movie, the CIA hosts highly sensitive data on a storage system inside a room with extremely tight physical security. Ethan Hunt infiltrates CIA headquarters and exploits a human target to gain physical access to the storage system. Once inside the secure room, he can exfiltrate data with relative ease.</p>
        
        <p>For at least a decade, alarming media reports have made us aware of the growing menace of security breaches that exploit human targets inside hardened organizational security perimeters. Even as employees work on highly secure corporate networks, they remain connected to the outside world through email and mobile devices. External threats effectively become internal threats.</p>
        
        <p>In a cloud-native environment, the notion of a hardened perimeter erodes further. All assets are connected to the outside world to some degree. While virtual private cloud (VPC) networks can be defined with no external connectivity, the API control plane that engineers use to define these networks still faces the internet.</p>

AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm46135133729504-marker" href="ch03.html#idm46135133729504">14</a></sup></p>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>AWS users are responsible for security in the cloud:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your organization’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In general, all cloud providers operate on some form of this shared responsibility model. They secure their services according to published specifications.

        <h2>Principle 9: Embrace FinOps</h2>
        
        <p>Let’s<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="principles of good data architecture" data-tertiary="embrace FinOps" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133013008"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="FinOps" data-type="indexterm" id="finops03"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="spending and resources, managing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133009888"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="financial management" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135133008768"></a> start by considering a couple of definitions of FinOps. First, the FinOps Foundation offers this:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm46135133007424-marker" href="ch03.html#idm46135133007424">16</a></sup></p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to get maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, technology, and business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In addition, J. R. Sorment and Mike Fuller provide the following definition in <em>Cloud FinOps</em>:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm46135133003808-marker" href="ch03.html#idm46135133003808">17</a></sup></p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>The term “FinOps” typically refers to the emerging professional movement that advocates a collaborative working relationship between DevOps and Finance, resulting in an iterative, data-driven management of infrastructure spending (i.e., lowering the unit economics of cloud) while simultaneously increasing the cost efficiency and, ultimately, the profitability of the cloud environment.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data" data-secondary="cost structure of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132999984"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cost" data-secondary="cost structure of data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132998576"></a> cost structure of data has evolved dramatically during the cloud era. In an on-premises setting, data systems are generally acquired with a capital expenditure (described more in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#choosing_technologies_across_the_data_e">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>) for a new system every few years in an on-premises setting. Responsible parties have to balance their budget against desired compute and storage capacity. Overbuying entails wasted money, while underbuying means hampering future data projects and driving significant personnel time to control system load and data size; underbuying may require faster technology refresh cycles, with associated extra costs.</p>
        
        <p>In the cloud era, most data systems are pay-as-you-go and readily<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="pay-as-you-go systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132995008"></a> scalable. Systems can run on a cost-per-query model, cost-per-processing-capacity model, or another variant of a pay-as-you-go model. This approach can be far more efficient than the capital expenditure approach. It is now possible to scale up for high performance, and then scale down to save money. However, the pay-as-you-go approach makes spending far more dynamic. The new challenge for data leaders is to manage budgets, priorities, and efficiency.</p>
        
        <p>Cloud tooling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud services" data-secondary="managing spending and resources" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132992544"></a> necessitates a set of processes for managing spending and resources. In the past, data engineers thought in terms of performance engineering—maximizing the performance for data processes on a fixed set of resources and buying adequate resources for future needs. With FinOps, engineers need to learn to think about the cost structures of cloud systems. For example, what is the appropriate mix of AWS spot instances when running a distributed cluster? What is the most appropriate approach for running a sizable daily job in terms of cost-effectiveness and performance? When should the company switch from a pay-per-query model to reserved capacity?</p>
        
        <p>FinOps evolves the operational monitoring model to monitor spending on an ongoing basis. Rather than simply monitor requests and CPU utilization for a web server, FinOps might monitor the ongoing cost of serverless functions handling traffic, as well as spikes in spending trigger alerts. Just as systems are designed to fail gracefully in excessive traffic, companies may consider adopting hard limits for spending, with graceful failure modes in response to spending spikes.</p>
        
        <p>Ops teams should also think in terms of cost attacks. Just as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack can block access to a web server, many companies have discovered to their chagrin that excessive downloads from S3 buckets can drive spending through the roof and threaten a small startup with bankruptcy. When sharing data publicly, data teams can address these issues by setting requester-pays policies, or simply monitoring for excessive data access spending and quickly removing access if spending begins to rise to unacceptable levels.</p>
        
        <p>As of this writing, FinOps is a recently formalized practice. The FinOps Foundation was started only in 2019.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn25-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn25">18</a></sup> However, we highly recommend you start thinking about FinOps early, before you encounter high cloud bills. Start your journey with the <a href="https://oreil.ly/4EOIB">FinOps Foundation</a> and O’Reilly’s <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/bdZRx"><em>Cloud FinOps</em></a>. We also suggest that data engineers involve themselves in the community process of creating FinOps practices for data engineering— in such a new practice area, a good deal of territory is yet to be mapped out.</p>

        <p>Before<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="major architecture concepts" data-tertiary="domains and services" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132967760"></a> diving into the components of the architecture, let’s briefly cover two terms you’ll see come up very often: domain and services. A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="domains" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132965856"></a> <em>domain</em> is the real-world subject area for which you’re architecting. A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="services" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132964176"></a> <em>service</em> is a set of functionality whose goal is to accomplish a task. For example, you might have a sales order-processing service whose task is to process orders as they are created. The sales order-processing service’s only job is to process orders; it doesn’t provide other functionality, such as inventory management or updating user profiles.</p>
        
        <p>A domain can contain multiple services. For example, you might have a sales domain with three services: orders, invoicing, and products. Each service has particular tasks that support the sales domain. Other domains may also share services (<a data-type="xref" href="#two_domains_left_parenthesissales_and_a">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>). In this case, the accounting domain is responsible for basic accounting functions: invoicing, payroll, and accounts receivable (AR). Notice the accounting domain shares the invoice service with the sales domain since a sale generates an invoice, and accounting must keep track of invoices to ensure that payment is received. Sales and accounting own their respective domains.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="two_domains_left_parenthesissales_and_a" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0303.png" width="600" height="157">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-3. </span>Two domains (sales and accounting) share a common service (invoices), and sales and accounting own their respective domains</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>When thinking about what constitutes a domain, focus on what the domain represents in the real world and work backward. In the preceding example, the sales domain should represent what happens with the sales function in your company. When architecting the sales domain, avoid cookie-cutter copying and pasting from what other companies do. Your company’s sales function likely has unique aspects that require specific services to make it work the way your sales team expects.</p>
        
        <p>Identify what should go in the domain. When determining what the domain should encompass and what services to include, the best advice is to simply go and talk with users and stakeholders, listen to what they’re saying, and build the services that will help them do their job. Avoid the classic trap of architecting in a vacuum.</p>

As data engineers, we’re interested in four closely related characteristics of data systems (availability and reliability were mentioned previously, but we reiterate them here for completeness):</p>

For example, we might want to scale a system to handle a high rate of queries or process a huge data set.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Elasticity</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="elastic systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132945216"></a> ability of a scalable system to scale dynamically; a highly elastic system can automatically scale up and down based on the current workload. Scaling up is critical as demand increases, while scaling down saves money in a cloud environment. Modern systems sometimes scale to zero, meaning they can automatically shut down when idle.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Availability</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="availability" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132942288"></a> percentage of time an IT service or component is in an operable state.</p>

            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
        <p>See PagerDuty’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/E6il3">“Why Are Availability and Reliability Crucial?” web page</a> for definitions and background on availability and reliability.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>How are these characteristics related? If a system fails to meet performance requirements during a specified interval, it may become unresponsive. Thus low reliability can lead to low availability. On the other hand, dynamic scaling helps ensure <span class="keep-together">adequate</span> performance without manual intervention from engineers—elasticity improves reliability.</p>
        
        <p>Scalability can be realized in a variety of ways. For your services and domains, does a single machine handle everything? A single machine can be scaled vertically; you can increase resources (CPU, disk, memory, I/O). But there are hard limits to possible resources on a single machine. Also, what happens if this machine dies? Given enough time, some components will eventually fail. What’s your plan for backup and failover? Single machines generally can’t offer high availability and reliability.</p>
        
        <p>We utilize a distributed system to realize higher overall scaling capacity and increased availability and reliability. <em>Horizontal scaling<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="horizontal scaling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134200928"></a></em> allows you to add more machines to satisfy load and resource requirements (<a data-type="xref" href="#a_simple_horizontal_distributed_system">Figure&nbsp;3-4</a>). Common horizontally scaled systems have a leader node that acts as the main point of contact for the instantiation, progress, and completion of workloads. When a workload is started, the leader node distributes tasks to the worker nodes within its system, completing the tasks and returning the results to the leader node. Typical modern distributed architectures also build in redundancy. Data is replicated so that if a machine dies, the other machines can pick up where the missing server left off; the cluster may add more machines to restore capacity.</p>
        
        <p>Distributed systems are widespread in the various data technologies you’ll use across your architecture. Almost every cloud data warehouse object storage system you use has some notion of distribution under the hood. Management details of the distributed system are typically abstracted away, allowing you to focus on high-level architecture instead of low-level plumbing.

On one end of the spectrum, you can choose to have extremely centralized dependencies and workflows. Every part of a domain and service is vitally dependent upon every other domain and service. This pattern is known as <em>tightly coupled</em>.</p>
        
        <p>On the other end of the spectrum, you have decentralized domains and services that do not have strict dependence on each other, in a pattern known as <em>loose coupling</em>. In a loosely coupled scenario, it’s easy for decentralized teams to build systems whose data may not be usable by their peers. Be sure to assign common standards, ownership, responsibility, and accountability to the teams owning their respective domains and services. Designing “good” data architecture relies on trade-offs between the tight and loose coupling of domains and services.</p>
        
        <p>It’s worth noting that many of the ideas in this section originate in software development. We’ll try to retain the context of these big ideas’ original intent and spirit—keeping them agnostic of data—while later explaining some differences you should be aware of when applying these concepts to data specifically.</p>

Your architecture has layers—data, application, business logic, presentation, and so forth—and you need to know how to decouple these layers. Because tight coupling of modalities presents obvious vulnerabilities, keep in mind how you structure the layers of your architecture to achieve maximum reliability and flexibility. Let’s look at single-tier and multitier architecture.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect4" data-pdf-bookmark="Single tier"><div class="sect4" id="single_tier">
        <h4>Single tier</h4>

This server could be your laptop or a single virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. The tightly coupled nature means if the server, the database, or the application fails, the entire architecture fails. While single-tier architectures are good for prototyping and development, they are not advised for production environments because of the obvious failure risks.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="single_tier_architecture" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0305.png" width="600" height="213">

        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Even when single-tier architectures build in redundancy (for example, a failover replica), they present significant limitations in other ways. For instance, it is often impractical (and not advisable) to run analytics queries against production application databases. Doing so risks overwhelming the database and causing the application to become unavailable. A single-tier architecture is fine for testing systems on a local machine but is not advised for production uses.</p>

        <section data-type="sect4" data-pdf-bookmark="Multitier"><div class="sect4" id="multitier">
        <h4>Multitier</h4>
        
        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multitier architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134168304"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tiers" data-secondary="multitier architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134167168"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="n-tier architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134165792"></a> challenges of a tightly coupled single-tier architecture are solved by decoupling the data and application. A <em>multitier</em> (also known as <em>n-tier</em>) architecture is composed of separate layers: data, application, business logic, presentation, etc. These layers are bottom-up and hierarchical, meaning the lower layer isn’t necessarily dependent on the upper layers; the upper layers depend on the lower layers. The notion is to separate data from the application, and application from the presentation.</p>
        
        <p>A common multitier architecture is a three-tier architecture, a widely used client-server design. A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="three-tier architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134162672"></a> <em>three-tier architecture</em> consists of data, application logic, and presentation tiers (<a data-type="xref" href="#a_three_tier_architecture">Figure&nbsp;3-6</a>). Each tier is isolated from the other, allowing for separation of concerns. With a three-tier architecture, you’re free to use whatever technologies you prefer within each tier without the need to be monolithically focused.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="a_three_tier_architecture" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0306.png" width="371" height="475">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-6. </span>A three-tier architecture</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>We’ve seen many single-tier architectures in production. Single-tier architectures offer simplicity but also severe limitations. Eventually, an organization or application outgrows this arrangement; it works well until it doesn’t. For instance, in a single-tier architecture, the data and logic layers share and compete for resources (disk, CPU, and memory) in ways that are simply avoided in a multitier architecture. Resources are spread across various tiers. Data engineers should use tiers to evaluate their layered architecture and the way dependencies are handled. Again, start simple and bake in evolution to additional tiers as your architecture becomes more complex.</p>
        
        <p>In a multitier architecture, you need to consider separating your layers and the way resources are shared within layers when working with a distributed system. Distributed systems under the hood power many technologies you’ll encounter across the data engineering lifecycle. First, think about whether you want resource contention with your nodes. If not, exercise a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shared-nothing architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134156624"></a> <em>shared-nothing architecture</em>: a single node handles each request, meaning other nodes do not share resources such as memory, disk, or CPU with this node or with each other. Data and resources are isolated to the node. Alternatively, various nodes can handle multiple requests and share resources but at the risk of resource contention. Another consideration is whether nodes should share the same disk and memory accessible by all nodes. This is called a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shared disk architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134154432"></a> <em>shared disk architecture</em> and is common when you want shared resources if a random node failure occurs.</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Monoliths"><div class="sect3" id="monoliths">
        <h3>Monoliths</h3>
        
        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="monolithic architectures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134150944"></a> general notion of a monolith includes as much as possible under one roof; in its most extreme version, a monolith consists of a single codebase running on a single machine that provides both the application logic and user interface.</p>
        
        <p>Coupling within monoliths can be viewed in two ways: technical coupling and domain coupling. <em>Technical coupling</em> <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="technical coupling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134148464"></a>refers to architectural tiers, while<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="domain coupling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134147200"></a> <em>domain coupling</em> refers to the way domains are coupled together. A monolith has varying degrees of coupling among technologies and domains. You could have an application with various layers decoupled in a multitier architecture but still share multiple domains. Or, you could have a single-tier architecture serving a single domain.</p>
        
        <p>The tight coupling of a monolith implies a lack of modularity of its components. Swapping out or upgrading components in a monolith is often an exercise in trading one pain for another. Because of the tightly coupled nature, reusing components across the architecture is difficult or impossible. When evaluating how to improve a monolithic architecture, it’s often a game of whack-a-mole: one component is improved, often at the expense of unknown consequences with other areas of the monolith.</p>
        
        <p>Data teams will often ignore solving the growing complexity of their monolith, letting it devolve into a <a href="https://oreil.ly/2brRT">big ball of mud</a>.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#choosing_technologies_across_the_data_e">Chapter&nbsp;4</a> provides a more extensive discussion comparing monoliths to distributed technologies. We also discuss the <em>distributed monolith</em>, a strange hybrid that emerges when engineers build distributed systems with excessive tight coupling.</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Microservices"><div class="sect3" id="microservices">
        <h3>Microservices</h3>
        
        <p>Compared<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="microservices architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134139392"></a> with the attributes of a monolith—interwoven services, centralization, and tight coupling among services—microservices are the polar opposite. <em>Microservices architecture</em> comprises separate, decentralized, and loosely coupled services. Each service has a specific function and is decoupled from other services operating within its domain. If one service temporarily goes down, it won’t affect the ability of other services to continue functioning.</p>
        
        <p>A question that comes up often is how to convert your monolith into many microservices (<a data-type="xref" href="#an_extremely_monolithic_architecture_ru">Figure&nbsp;3-7</a>). This completely depends on how complex your monolith is and how much effort it will be to start extracting services out of it. It’s entirely possible that your monolith cannot be broken apart, in which case, you’ll want to start creating a new parallel architecture that has the services decoupled in a microservices-friendly manner. We don’t suggest an entire refactor but instead break out services. The monolith didn’t arrive overnight and is a technology issue as an organizational one. Be sure you get buy-in from stakeholders of the monolith if you plan to break it apart.</p>

        <h3>Considerations for data architecture</h3>
        
        <p>As<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="major architecture concepts" data-tertiary="considerations for data architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134129552"></a> we mentioned at the start of this section, the concepts of tight versus loose coupling stem from software development, with some of these concepts dating back over 20 years. Though architectural practices in data are now adopting those from software development, it’s still common to see very monolithic, tightly coupled data architectures. Some of this is due to the nature of existing data technologies and the way they integrate.</p>
        
        <p>For example, data pipelines might consume data from many sources ingested into a central data warehouse. The central data warehouse is inherently monolithic. A move toward a microservices equivalent with a data warehouse is to decouple the workflow with domain-specific data pipelines connecting to corresponding domain-specific data warehouses. For example, the sales data pipeline connects to the sales-specific data warehouse, and the inventory and product domains follow a similar pattern.</p>
        
        <p>Rather than dogmatically preach microservices over monoliths (among other arguments), we suggest you pragmatically use loose coupling as an ideal, while recognizing the state and limitations of the data technologies you’re using within your data architecture. Incorporate reversible technology choices that allow for modularity and loose coupling whenever possible.</p>
        
        <p>As you can see in <a data-type="xref" href="#an_extremely_monolithic_architecture_ru">Figure&nbsp;3-7</a>, you separate the components of your architecture into different layers of concern in a vertical fashion. While a multitier architecture solves the technical challenges of decoupling shared resources, it does not address the complexity of sharing domains. Along the lines of single versus multitiered architecture, you should also consider how you separate the domains of your data architecture. For example, your analyst team might rely on data from sales and inventory. The sales and inventory domains are different and should be viewed as separate.</p>
        
        <p>One approach to this problem is centralization: a single team is responsible for gathering data from all domains and reconciling it for consumption across the organization. (This is a common approach in traditional data warehousing.) Another approach is the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data mesh" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134122816"></a> <em>data mesh</em>. With the data mesh, each software team is responsible for preparing its data for consumption across the rest of the organization. We’ll say more about the data mesh later in this chapter.</p>
        
        <p>Our advice: monoliths aren’t necessarily bad, and it might make sense to start with one under certain conditions. Sometimes you need to move fast, and it’s much simpler to start with a monolith. Just be prepared to break it into smaller pieces eventually; don’t get too comfortable.</p>

In some sense, all<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud services" data-secondary="multitenancy support" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134115280"></a> cloud services are <span class="keep-together">multitenant,</span> although this multitenancy occurs at various grains. For example, a cloud compute instance is usually on a shared server, but the VM itself provides some degree of isolation. Object storage is a multitenant system, but cloud vendors guarantee security and isolation so long as customers configure their permissions correctly.</p>
        
        <p>Engineers frequently need to make decisions about multitenancy at a much smaller scale. For example, do multiple departments in a large company share the same data warehouse? Does the organization share data for multiple large customers within the same table?</p>
        
        <p>We<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="performance" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134111136"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="single versus multitenant" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134110000"></a> have two factors to consider in multitenancy: performance and security. With multiple large tenants within a cloud system, will the system support consistent performance for all tenants, or will there be a noisy neighbor problem? (That is, will high usage from one tenant degrade performance for other tenants?) Regarding security, data from different tenants must be properly isolated. When a company has multiple external customer tenants, these tenants should not be aware of one another, and engineers must prevent data leakage. Strategies for data isolation vary by system. For instance, it is often perfectly acceptable to use multitenant tables and isolate data through views. However, you must make certain that these views cannot leak data. Read vendor or project documentation to understand appropriate strategies and risks.</p>

Things often happen in your business, such as getting a new customer, a new order from a customer, or an order for a product or service. These are all examples of <em>events</em> that are broadly defined as something that happened, typically a change in the <em>state</em> of something. For example, a new order might be created by a customer, or a customer might later make an update to this order.</p>
        
        <p>An event-driven workflow (<a data-type="xref" href="#in_an_event_driven_workflowcomma_an_eve">Figure&nbsp;3-8</a>) encompasses the ability to create, update, and asynchronously move events across various parts of the data engineering lifecycle. This workflow boils down to three main areas: event production, routing, and consumption. An event must be produced and routed to something that consumes it without tightly coupled dependencies among the producer, event router, and <span class="keep-together">consumer.</span></p>

        <p>An event-driven architecture (<a data-type="xref" href="#in_an_event_driven_architecturecomma_ev">Figure&nbsp;3-9</a>) embraces the event-driven workflow and uses this to communicate across various services. The advantage of an event-driven architecture is that it distributes the state of an event across multiple services. This is helpful if a service goes offline, a node fails in a distributed system, or you’d like multiple consumers or services to access the same events. Anytime you have loosely coupled services, this is a candidate for event-driven architecture. Many of the examples we describe later in this chapter incorporate some form of event-driven architecture.</p>

Each type of project requires assessing trade-offs, albeit with different considerations and approaches. Projects roughly fall into two buckets: brownfield and greenfield.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Brownfield projects"><div class="sect3" id="brownfield_projects">
        <h3>Brownfield projects</h3>
        
        <p><em>Brownfield projects</em> often<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="brownfield projects" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134086144"></a> involve refactoring and reorganizing an existing architecture and are constrained by the choices of the present and past. Because a key part of architecture is change management, you must figure out a way around these limitations and design a path forward to achieve your new business and technical objectives. Brownfield projects require a thorough understanding of the legacy architecture and the interplay of various old and new technologies. All too often, it’s easy to criticize a prior team’s work and decisions, but it is far better to dig deep, ask questions, and understand why decisions were made. Empathy and context go a long way in helping you diagnose problems with the existing architecture, identify opportunities, and recognize pitfalls.</p>
        
        <p>You’ll need to introduce your new architecture and technologies and deprecate the old stuff at some point. Let’s look at a couple of popular approaches. Many teams jump headfirst into an all-at-once or big-bang overhaul of the old architecture, often figuring out deprecation as they go. Though popular, we don’t advise this approach because of the associated risks and lack of a plan. This path often leads to disaster, with many irreversible and costly decisions. Your job is to make reversible, high-ROI decisions.</p>
        
        <p>A popular alternative to a direct rewrite is the strangler pattern: new systems slowly and incrementally replace a legacy architecture’s components.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn26-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn26">20</a></sup> Eventually, the legacy architecture is completely replaced. The attraction to the strangler pattern is its tar­ge⁠ted and surgical approach of deprecating one piece of a system at a time. This allows for flexible and reversible decisions while assessing the impact of the deprecation on dependent systems.</p>
        
        <p>It’s important to note that deprecation might be “ivory tower” advice and not practical or achievable. Eradicating legacy technology or architecture might be impossible if you’re at a large organization. Someone, somewhere, is using these legacy components. As someone once said, “Legacy is a condescending way to describe something that makes money.”</p>
        
        <p>If you can deprecate, understand there are numerous ways to deprecate your old architecture. It is critical to demonstrate value on the new platform by gradually increasing its maturity to show evidence of success and then follow an exit plan to shut down old systems.</p>

        <p>Because<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="examples and types of" data-type="indexterm" id="DAexamples03"></a> data architecture is an abstract discipline, it helps to reason by example. In this section, we outline prominent examples and types of data architecture that are popular today.

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Warehouse"><div class="sect2" id="data_warehouse">
        <h2>Data Warehouse</h2>
        
        <p>A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="examples and types of" data-tertiary="data warehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134060432"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data warehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="dware03"></a> <em>data warehouse</em> is a central data hub used for reporting and analysis. Data in a data warehouse is typically highly formatted and structured for analytics use cases. It’s among the oldest and most well-established data architectures.</p>
        
        <p>In 1989, Bill Inmon originated the notion of the data warehouse, which he described as “a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management’s decisions.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn28-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn28">22</a></sup> Though technical aspects of the data warehouse have evolved significantly, we feel this original definition still holds its weight today.</p>
        
        <p>In the past, data warehouses were widely used at enterprises with significant budgets (often in the millions of dollars) to acquire data systems and pay internal teams to provide ongoing support to maintain the data warehouse. This was expensive and labor-intensive. Since then, the scalable, pay-as-you-go model has made cloud data warehouses accessible even to tiny companies. Because a third-party provider manages the data warehouse infrastructure, companies can do a lot more with fewer people, even as the complexity of their data grows.</p>
        
        <p>It’s worth noting two types of data warehouse architecture: organizational and technical. The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="organizational data warehouse architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134052864"></a> <em>organizational data warehouse architecture</em> organizes data associated with certain business team structures and processes. The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="technical data warehouse architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134051088"></a> <em>technical data warehouse architecture</em> reflects the technical nature of the data warehouse, such as MPP. A company can have a data warehouse without an MPP system or run an MPP system that is not organized as a data warehouse. However, the technical and organizational architectures have existed in a virtuous cycle and are frequently identified with each other.</p>
        
        <p>The organizational data warehouse architecture has two main characteristics:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Separates online analytical processing (OLAP) from production databases (online transaction processing)</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>This separation is critical as businesses grow. Moving data into a separate physical system directs load away from production systems and improves analytics performance.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Centralizes and organizes data</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Traditionally, a data warehouse<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="extract, transform, load (ETL) process" data-secondary="data warehouses and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134045744"></a> pulls data from application systems by using ETL. The extract phase pulls data from source systems. The transformation phase cleans and standardizes data, organizing and imposing business logic in a highly modeled form. (<a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#queriescomma_modelingcomma_and_transfor">Chapter&nbsp;8</a> covers transformations and data models.) The load phase pushes data into the data warehouse target database system. Data is loaded into multiple data marts that serve the analytical needs for specific lines or business and departments. <a data-type="xref" href="#basic_data_warehouse_with_etl">Figure&nbsp;3-10</a> shows the general workflow. The data warehouse and ETL go hand in hand with specific business structures, including DBA and ETL developer teams that implement the direction of business leaders to ensure that data for reporting and analytics corresponds to business processes.</p>

            </div></figure>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>Regarding the technical data warehouse architecture, the first<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="parallel processing databases" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134038784"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="massively parallel processing (MPP) databases" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134037536"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MPP (massively parallel processing) databases" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134036336"></a> MPP systems in the late 1970s became popular in the 1980s. MPPs support essentially the same SQL semantics used in relational application databases. Still, they are optimized to scan massive amounts of data in parallel and thus allow high-performance aggregation and statistical calculations. In recent years, MPP systems have increasingly shifted from a row-based to a columnar architecture to facilitate even larger data and queries, especially in cloud data warehouses. MPPs are indispensable for running performant queries for large enterprises as data and reporting needs grow.</p>
        
        <p>One<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="extract, load, and transform (ELT)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134034656"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ELT (extract, load, and transform)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134033504"></a> variation on ETL is ELT. With the ELT data warehouse architecture, data gets moved more or less directly from production systems into a staging area in the data warehouse. Staging in this setting indicates that the data is in a raw form. Rather than using an external system, transformations are handled directly in the data warehouse. The intention is to take advantage of the massive computational power of cloud data warehouses and data processing tools. Data is processed in batches, and transformed output is written into tables and views for analytics. <a data-type="xref" href="#eltem_dashextractcomma_loadcomma_and_tr">Figure&nbsp;3-11</a> shows the general process. ELT is also popular in a streaming arrangement, as events are streamed from a CDC process, stored in a staging area, and then subsequently transformed within the data warehouse.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="eltem_dashextractcomma_loadcomma_and_tr" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0311.png" width="600" height="170">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 3-11. </span>ELT—extract, load, and transform</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>A second version of ELT was popularized during big data growth in the Hadoop ecosystem. This is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="transform-on-read ELT" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134028144"></a> <em>transform-on-read ELT</em>, which we discuss in <a data-type="xref" href="#data_lake">“Data Lake”</a>.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="The cloud data warehouse"><div class="sect3" id="the_cloud_data_warehouse">
        <h3>The cloud data warehouse</h3>
        
        <p><em>Cloud data warehouses</em> represent<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud data warehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135134023152"></a> a significant evolution of the on-premises data warehouse architecture and have thus led to significant changes to the organizational architecture. Amazon Redshift kicked off the cloud data warehouse revolution. Instead of needing to appropriately size an MPP system for the next several years and sign a multimillion-dollar contract to procure the system, companies had the option of spinning up a Redshift cluster on demand, scaling it up over time as data and analytics demand grew. They could even spin up new Redshift clusters on demand to serve specific workloads and quickly delete clusters when they were no longer needed.</p>
        
        <p>Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and other competitors popularized the idea of separating compute from storage. In this architecture, data is housed in object storage, allowing virtually limitless storage. This also gives users the option to spin up computing power on demand, providing ad hoc big data capabilities without the long-term cost of thousands of nodes.</p>
        
        <p>Cloud data warehouses expand the capabilities of MPP systems to cover many big data use cases that required a Hadoop cluster in the very recent past. They can readily process petabytes of data in a single query. They typically support data structures that allow the storage of tens of megabytes of raw text data per row or extremely rich and complex JSON documents. As cloud data warehouses (and data lakes) mature, the line between the data warehouse and the data lake will continue to blur.</p>
        
        <p>So significant is the impact of the new capabilities offered by cloud data warehouses that we might consider jettisoning the term <em>data warehouse</em> altogether. Instead, these services are evolving into a new data platform with much broader capabilities than those offered by a traditional MPP system.</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Data marts"><div class="sect3" id="data_marts">
        <h3>Data marts</h3>
        
        <p>A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data marts" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132594384"></a> <em>data mart</em> is a more refined subset of a warehouse designed to serve analytics and reporting, focused on a single suborganization, department, or line of business; every department has its own data mart, specific to its needs. This is in contrast to the full data warehouse that serves the broader organization or business.</p>
        
        <p>Data marts exist for two reasons. First, a data mart makes data more easily accessible to analysts and report developers. Second, data marts provide an additional stage of transformation beyond that provided by the initial ETL or ELT pipelines. This can significantly improve performance if reports or analytics queries require complex joins and aggregations of data, especially when the raw data is large. Transform processes can populate the data mart with joined and aggregated data to improve performance for live queries. <a data-type="xref" href="#etl_or_elt_plus_data_marts">Figure&nbsp;3-12</a> shows the general workflow.

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Data Lake"><div class="sect2" id="data_lake">
        <h2>Data Lake</h2>
        
        <p>Among<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="examples and types of" data-tertiary="data lakes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132584880"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data lakes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132583200"></a> the most popular architectures that appeared during the big data era is the <em>data lake</em>. Instead of imposing tight structural limitations on data, why not simply dump all of your data—structured and unstructured—into a central location? The data lake promised to be a democratizing force, liberating the business to drink from a fountain of limitless data. The first-generation data lake, “data lake 1.0,” made solid contributions but generally failed to deliver on its promise.</p>
        
        <p>Data lake 1.0 started with HDFS. As the cloud grew in popularity, these data lakes moved to cloud-based object storage, with extremely cheap storage costs and virtually limitless storage capacity. Instead of relying on a monolithic data warehouse where storage and compute are tightly coupled, the data lake allows an immense amount of data of any size and type to be stored. When this data needs to be queried or transformed, you have access to nearly unlimited computing power by spinning up a cluster on demand, and you can pick your favorite data-processing technology for the task at hand—MapReduce, Spark, Ray, Presto, Hive, etc.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the promise and hype, data lake 1.0 had serious shortcomings. The data lake became a dumping ground; terms such as<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data swamps" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132579936"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dark data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132578832"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="write once, read never (WORN)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132577728"></a> <em>data swamp</em>, <em>dark data</em>, and <em>WORN</em> were coined as once-promising data projects failed. Data grew to unmanageable sizes, with little in the way of schema management, data cataloging, and discovery tools. In addition, the original data lake concept was essentially write-only, creating huge headaches with the arrival of regulations such as GDPR that required targeted deletion of user records.</p>
        
        <p>Processing data was also challenging. Relatively banal data transformations such as joins were a huge headache to code as MapReduce jobs. Later frameworks such as Pig and Hive somewhat improved the situation for data processing but did little to address the basic problems of data management. Simple data manipulation language (DML) operations common in SQL—deleting or updating rows—were painful to implement, generally achieved by creating entirely new tables. While big data engineers radiated a particular disdain for their counterparts in data warehousing, the latter could point out that data warehouses provided basic data management capabilities out of the box, and that SQL was an efficient tool for writing complex, performant queries and transformations.</p>
        
        <p>Data lake 1.0 also failed to deliver on another core promise of the big data movement. Open source software in the Apache ecosystem was touted as a means to avoid multimillion-dollar contracts for proprietary MPP systems. Cheap, off-the-shelf hardware would replace custom vendor solutions. In reality, big data costs ballooned as the complexities of managing Hadoop clusters forced companies to hire large teams of engineers at high salaries. Companies often chose to purchase licensed, customized versions of Hadoop from vendors to avoid the exposed wires and sharp edges of the raw Apache codebase and acquire a set of scaffolding tools to make Hadoop more user-friendly. Even companies that avoided managing Hadoop clusters using cloud storage had to spend big on talent to write MapReduce jobs.</p>
        
        <p>We should be careful not to understate the utility and power of first-generation data lakes. Many organizations found significant value in data lakes—especially huge, heavily data-focused Silicon Valley tech companies like Netflix and Facebook. These companies had the resources to build successful data practices and create their custom Hadoop-based tools and enhancements. But for many organizations, data lakes turned into an internal superfund site of waste, disappointment, and spiraling costs.</p>

        <h2>Convergence, Next-Generation Data Lakes, and the Data Platform</h2>
        
        <p>In<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="examples and types of" data-tertiary="trend toward convergence" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132571152"></a> response to the limitations of first-generation data lakes, various players have sought to enhance the concept to fully realize its promise. For example, Databricks introduced the notion of a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data lakehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132569168"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="lakehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132568064"></a> <em>data lakehouse</em>. The lakehouse incorporates the controls, data management, and data structures found in a data warehouse while still housing data in object storage and supporting a variety of query and transformation engines. In particular, the data lakehouse supports<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132566112"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) transactions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132564960"></a> atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions, a big departure from the original data lake, where you simply pour in data and never update or delete it. The term <em>data lakehouse</em> suggests a convergence between data lakes and data warehouses.</p>
        
        <p>The technical architecture of cloud data warehouses has evolved to be very similar to a data lake architecture. Cloud data warehouses separate compute from storage, support petabyte-scale queries, store a variety of unstructured data and semistructured objects, and integrate with advanced processing technologies such as Spark or Beam.</p>
        
        <p>We believe that the trend of convergence will only continue. The data lake and the data warehouse will still exist as different architectures. In practice, their capabilities will converge so that few users will notice a boundary between them in their day-to-day work. We now see several vendors offering<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data platforms" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132561600"></a> <em>data platforms</em> that combine data lake and data warehouse capabilities. From our perspective, AWS, Azure, <a href="https://oreil.ly/ij2QV">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://oreil.ly/NoE9p">Snowflake</a>, and Databricks are class leaders, each offering a constellation of tightly integrated tools for working with data, running the gamut from relational to completely unstructured. Instead of choosing between a data lake or data warehouse architecture, future data engineers will have the option to choose a converged data platform based on a variety of factors, including vendor, ecosystem, and relative openness.</p>

Whereas past data stacks relied on expensive, monolithic toolsets, the main objective of the modern data stack is to use cloud-based, plug-and-play, easy-to-use, off-the-shelf components to create a modular and cost-effective data architecture. These components include data pipelines, storage, transformation, data management/governance, monitoring, visualization, and exploration. The domain is still in flux, and the specific tools are changing and evolving rapidly, but the core aim will remain the same: to reduce complexity and increase modularization. Note that the notion of a modern data stack integrates nicely with the converged data platform idea from the previous section.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="basic_components_of_the_modern_data_sta" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0313.png" width="600" height="88">

        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Key outcomes of the modern data stack are self-service (analytics and pipelines), agile data management, and using open source tools or simple proprietary tools with clear pricing structures. Community is a central aspect of the modern data stack as well. Unlike products of the past that had releases and roadmaps largely hidden from users, projects and companies operating in the modern data stack space typically have strong user bases and active communities that participate in the development by using the product early, suggesting features, and submitting pull requests to improve the code.</p>
        
        <p>Regardless of where “modern” goes (we share our ideas in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#the_future_of_data_engineering">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>), we think the key concept of plug-and-play modularity with easy-to-understand pricing and implementation is the way of the future. Especially in analytics engineering, the modern data stack is and will continue to be the default choice of data architecture. Throughout the book, the architecture we reference contains pieces of the modern data stack, such as cloud-based and plug-and-play modular components.</p>

These technologies allowed companies to perform new types of analytics and modeling on large amounts of data, user aggregation and ranking, and product recommendations. Data engineers needed to figure out how to reconcile batch and streaming data into a single architecture. The Lambda architecture was one of the early popular responses to this problem.</p>
        
        <p>In a <em>Lambda architecture</em> (<a data-type="xref" href="#lambda_architecture-id000058">Figure&nbsp;3-14</a>), you have systems operating independently of each other—batch, streaming, and serving. The source system is ideally immutable and append-only, sending data to two destinations for processing: stream and batch. In-stream processing intends to serve the data with the lowest possible latency in a “speed” layer, usually a NoSQL database. In the batch layer, data is processed and transformed in a system such as a data warehouse, creating precomputed and aggregated views of the data. The serving layer provides a combined view by aggregating query results from the two layers.</p>

This facilitates a true event-based architecture. Real-time and batch processing can be applied seamlessly to the same data by reading the live event stream directly and replaying large chunks of data for batch processing.</p>

        <p>Though the original Kappa architecture article came out in 2014, we haven’t seen it widely adopted. There may be a couple of reasons for this. First, streaming itself is still a bit of a mystery for many companies; it’s easy to talk about, but harder than expected to execute. Second, Kappa architecture turns out to be complicated and expensive in practice. While some streaming systems can scale to huge data volumes, they are complex and expensive; batch storage and processing remain much more efficient and cost-effective for enormous historical datasets.</p>

        <h2>The Dataflow Model and Unified Batch and Streaming</h2>
        
        <p>Both<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="examples and types of" data-tertiary="Dataflow model and unified batch and streaming" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132519488"></a> Lambda and Kappa sought to address limitations of the Hadoop ecosystem of the 2010s by trying to duct-tape together complicated tools that were likely not natural fits in the first place. The central challenge of unifying batch and streaming data remained, and Lambda and Kappa both provided inspiration and groundwork for continued progress in this pursuit.</p>
        
        <p>One of the central problems of managing batch and stream processing is unifying multiple code paths. While the Kappa architecture relies on a unified queuing and storage layer, one still has to confront using different tools for collecting real-time statistics or running batch aggregation jobs. Today, engineers seek to solve this in several ways. Google made its mark by developing the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Dataflow model" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132516400"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Apache Beam framework" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132515296"></a> <a href="https://oreil.ly/qrxY4">Dataflow model</a> and the <a href="https://beam.apache.org">Apache Beam</a> framework that implements this model.</p>
        
        <p>The core idea in the Dataflow model is to view all data as events, as the aggregation is performed over various types of windows. Ongoing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="unbounded data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132511824"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data" data-secondary="unbounded data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132510720"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="real-time data ingestion" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132509344"></a> real-time event streams are <em>unbounded data</em>. Data batches are simply bounded event streams, and the boundaries provide a natural window. Engineers can choose from various<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="windowing methods" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132507536"></a> windows for real-time aggregation, such as sliding or tumbling.

        <p>The philosophy of “batch as a special case of streaming” is now more pervasive. Various frameworks such as Flink and Spark have adopted a similar approach.</p>

        <h2>Architecture for IoT</h2>
        
        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data architecture" data-secondary="examples and types of" data-tertiary="architecture for IoT" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135132501312"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Internet of Things  (IoT)" data-type="indexterm" id="IOT03"></a> <em>Internet of Things</em> (IoT) is the distributed collection of devices, aka <em>things</em>—computers, sensors, mobile devices, smart home devices, and anything else with an internet connection. Rather than generating data from direct human input (think data entry from a keyboard), IoT data is generated from devices that collect data periodically or continuously from the surrounding environment and transmit it to a destination. IoT devices are often low-powered and operate in low-resource/low bandwidth environments.</p>
        
        <p>While the concept of IoT devices dates back at least a few decades, the smartphone revolution created a massive IoT swarm virtually overnight. Since then, numerous new IoT categories have emerged, such as smart thermostats, car entertainment systems, smart TVs, and smart speakers. The IoT has evolved from a futurist fantasy to a massive data engineering domain. We expect IoT to become one of the dominant ways data is generated and consumed, and this section goes a bit deeper than the others you’ve read.</p>
        
        <p>Having a cursory understanding of IoT architecture will help you understand broader data architecture trends. Let’s briefly look at some IoT architecture concepts.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Devices"><div class="sect3" id="devices">
        <h3>Devices</h3>
        
        <p><em>Devices</em> (also known as <em>things</em>) are<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="devices" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135048544"></a> the physical hardware connected to the internet, sensing the environment around them and collecting and transmitting data to a downstream destination. These devices might be used in consumer applications like a doorbell camera, smartwatch, or thermostat. The device might be an AI-powered camera that monitors an assembly line for defective components, a GPS tracker to record vehicle locations, or a Raspberry Pi programmed to download the latest tweets and brew your coffee. Any device capable of collecting data from its environment is an IoT device.</p>
        
        <p>Devices should be minimally capable of collecting and transmitting data. However, the device might also crunch data or run ML on the data it collects before sending it downstream—edge computing and edge machine learning, respectively.</p>
        
        <p>A data engineer doesn’t necessarily need to know the inner details of IoT devices but should know what the device does, the data it collects, any edge computations or ML it runs before transmitting the data, and how often it sends data. It also helps to know the consequences of a device or internet outage, environmental or other external factors affecting data collection, and how these may impact the downstream collection of data from the device.</p>

        <h3>Interfacing with devices</h3>
        
        <p>A device isn’t beneficial unless you can get its data. This section covers some of the key components necessary to interface with IoT devices in the wild.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect4" data-pdf-bookmark="IoT gateway"><div class="sect4" id="iot_gateway">
        <h4>IoT gateway</h4>
        
        <p>An <em>IoT gateway</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="IoT gateways" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135040720"></a> a hub for connecting devices and securely routing devices to the appropriate destinations on the internet. While you can connect a device directly to the internet without an IoT gateway, the gateway allows devices to connect using extremely little power. It acts as a way station for data retention and manages an internet connection to the final data destination.</p>
        
        <p>New low-power WiFi standards are designed to make IoT gateways less critical in the future, but these are just rolling out now. Typically, a swarm of devices will utilize many IoT gateways, one at each physical location where devices are present (<a data-type="xref" href="#a_device_swarm_left_parenthesiscirclesr">Figure&nbsp;3-16</a>).</p>
        
        <figure><div id="a_device_swarm_left_parenthesiscirclesr" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0316.png" width="600" height="249">

        <section data-type="sect4" data-pdf-bookmark="Ingestion"><div class="sect4" id="ingestion-id000054">
        <h4>Ingestion</h4>
        
        <p><em>Ingestion</em> begins<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ingestion stage" data-secondary="IoT gateways and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135033344"></a> with an IoT gateway, as discussed previously. From there, events and measurements can flow into an event ingestion architecture.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, other patterns are possible. For instance, the gateway may accumulate data and upload it in batches for later analytics processing. In remote physical environments, gateways may not have connectivity to a network much of the time. They may upload all data only when they are brought into the range of a cellular or WiFi network. The point is that the diversity of IoT systems and environments presents complications—e.g., late-arriving data, data structure and schema disparities, data corruption, and connection disruption—that engineers must account for in their architectures and downstream analytics.</p>

        <p>Storage requirements<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="IoT devices and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135028752"></a> will depend a great deal on the latency requirement for the IoT devices in the system. For example, for remote sensors collecting scientific data for analysis at a later time, batch object storage may be perfectly acceptable. However, near real-time responses may be expected from a system backend that constantly analyzes data in a home monitoring and automation solution. In this case, a message queue or time-series database is more appropriate. We discuss storage systems in more detail in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#storage-id000094">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>.</p>

        <h4>Serving</h4>
        
        <p>Serving patterns<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="serving data stage" data-secondary="IoT devices and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135135023680"></a> are incredibly diverse. In a batch scientific application, data might be analyzed using a cloud data warehouse and then served in a report. Data will be presented and served in numerous ways in a home-monitoring application. Data will be analyzed in the near time using a stream-processing engine or queries in a time-series database to look for critical events such as a fire, electrical outage, or break-in. Detection of an anomaly will trigger alerts to the homeowner, the fire department, or other entity. A batch analytics component also exists—for example, a monthly report on the state of the home.</p>
        
        <p>One significant serving pattern for IoT looks like reverse ETL (<a data-type="xref" href="#iot_serving_pattern_for_downstream_use">Figure&nbsp;3-17</a>), although we tend not to use this term in the IoT context. Think of this scenario: data from sensors on manufacturing devices is collected and analyzed. The results of these measurements are processed to look for optimizations that will allow equipment to operate more efficiently. Data is sent back to reconfigure the devices and optimize them.</p>

Because the data mesh has captured much recent attention, you should be aware of it.</p>
        
        <p>A big part of the data mesh is decentralization, as Zhamak Dehghani noted in her groundbreaking article on the topic:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn31-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn31">25</a></sup></p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>In order to decentralize the monolithic data platform, we need to reverse how we think about data, its locality, and ownership. Instead of flowing the data from domains into a centrally owned data lake or platform, domains need to host and serve their domain datasets in an easily consumable way.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Dehghani later identified four key components of the data mesh:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn32-marker" href="ch03.html#ch01fn32">26</a></sup></p>

Bigger companies may still employ data architects, but those architects will need to be heavily in tune and current with the state of technology and data. Gone are the days of ivory tower data architecture. In the past, architecture was largely orthogonal to engineering. We expect this distinction will disappear as data engineering, and engineering in general, quickly evolves, becoming more agile, with less separation between engineering and architecture.</p>
        
        <p>Ideally, a data engineer will work alongside a dedicated data architect. However, if a company is small or low in its level of data maturity, a data engineer might work double duty as an architect. Because data architecture is an undercurrent of the data engineering lifecycle, a data engineer should understand “good” architecture and the various types of data architecture.</p>
