        <p>Storage is the cornerstone of the data engineering lifecycle (<a data-type="xref" href="#storage_plays_a_central_role_in_the_dat">Figure&nbsp;6-1</a>) and underlies its major stages—ingestion, transformation, and serving. Data gets stored many times as it moves through the lifecycle. To paraphrase an old saying, it’s storage all the way down. Whether data is needed seconds, minutes, days, months, or years later, it must persist in storage until systems are ready to consume it for further processing and transmission. Knowing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="selecting storage systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117379056"></a> the use case of the data and the way you will retrieve it in the future is the first step to choosing the proper storage solutions for your data architecture.</p>

        <p class="pagebreak-before">We also discussed storage in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data_generation_in_source_systems">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, but with a difference in focus and domain of control. Source systems are generally not maintained or controlled by data engineers. The storage that data engineers handle directly, which we’ll focus on in this chapter, encompasses<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="lifecycle stages encompassed by" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117373952"></a> the data engineering lifecycle stages of ingesting data from source systems to serving data to deliver value with analytics, data science, etc. Many forms of storage undercut the entire data engineering lifecycle in some fashion.</p>
        
        <p>To understand storage, we’re going to start by studying the <em>raw ingredients</em> that compose storage systems, including hard drives, solid state drives, and system memory (see <a data-type="xref" href="#raw_ingredientscomma_storage_systemscom">Figure&nbsp;6-2</a>). It’s<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="physical and software elements of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117369984"></a> essential to understand the basic characteristics of physical storage technologies to assess the trade-offs inherent in any storage architecture. This section also discusses serialization and compression, key software elements of practical storage. (We defer a deeper technical discussion of serialization and compression to <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#a_serialization_and_compression_technic">Appendix&nbsp;A</a>.) We also discuss <em>caching</em>, which is critical in assembling storage systems.</p>

        <p>Next, we’ll look at <em>storage systems</em>. In practice, we don’t directly access system memory or hard disks. These physical storage components exist inside servers and clusters that can ingest and retrieve data using various access paradigms.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we’ll look at <em>storage abstractions</em>. Storage systems are assembled into a cloud data warehouse, a data lake, etc. When building data pipelines, engineers choose the appropriate abstractions for storing their data as it moves through the ingestion, transformation, and serving stages.</p>

        <h1>Raw Ingredients of Data Storage</h1>
        
        <p>Storage<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-type="indexterm" id="SSraw06"></a> is so common that it’s easy to take it for granted. We’re often surprised by the number of software and data engineers who use storage every day but have little idea how it works behind the scenes or the trade-offs inherent in various storage media. As a result, we see storage used in some pretty...interesting ways. Though current managed services potentially free data engineers from the complexities of managing servers, data engineers still need to be aware of underlying components’ essential characteristics, performance considerations, durability, and costs.</p>
        
        <p>In most data architectures, data frequently passes through magnetic storage, SSDs, and memory as it works its way through the various processing phases of a data pipeline. Data storage and query systems generally follow complex recipes involving distributed systems, numerous services, and multiple hardware storage layers. These systems require the right raw ingredients to function correctly.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s look at some of the raw ingredients of data storage: disk drives, memory, networking and CPU, serialization, compression, and caching.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Magnetic Disk Drive"><div class="sect2" id="magnetic_disk_drive">
        <h2>Magnetic Disk Drive</h2>
        
        <p><em>Magnetic disks</em> utilize<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-tertiary="magnetic disks" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117354896"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="magnetic disks" data-type="indexterm" id="magdisk06"></a> spinning platters coated with a ferromagnetic film (<a data-type="xref" href="#magnetic_disk_head_movement_and_rotatio">Figure&nbsp;6-3</a>). This film is magnetized by a read/write head during write operations to physically encode binary data. The read/write head detects the magnetic field and outputs a bitstream during read operations. Magnetic disk drives have been around for ages. They still form the backbone of<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bulk data storage systems" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117350272"></a> bulk data storage systems because they are significantly cheaper than SSDs per gigabyte of stored data.</p>
        
        <p>On the one hand, these disks have seen extraordinary improvements in performance, storage density, and cost.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn54-marker" href="ch06.html#ch01fn54">1</a></sup> On the other hand, SSDs dramatically outperform magnetic disks on various metrics. Currently, commercial magnetic disk drives cost roughly 3 cents per gigabyte of capacity. (Note that we’ll frequently use the <span class="keep-together">abbreviations</span> <em>HDD</em> and <em>SSD</em> to denote rotating magnetic disk and solid-state drives, respectively.)</p>
        
        <figure><div id="magnetic_disk_head_movement_and_rotatio" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0603.png" width="600" height="771">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 6-3. </span>Magnetic disk head movement and rotation are essential in random access latency</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>IBM developed magnetic disk drive technology in the 1950s. Since then, magnetic disk capacities have grown steadily. The first commercial magnetic disk drive, the IBM 350, had a capacity of 3.75 megabytes. As of this writing, magnetic drives storing 20 TB are commercially available. In fact, magnetic disks continue to see rapid innovation, with methods such as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), shingled magnetic recording (SMR), and helium-filled disk enclosures being used to realize ever greater storage densities. In spite of the continuing improvements in drive capacity, other aspects of HDD performance are hampered by physics.</p>
        
        <p>First, <em>disk transfer speed</em>, the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="disk transfer speed" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117340352"></a> rate at which data can be read and written, does not scale in proportion with disk capacity. Disk capacity scales with<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="areal density" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117338960"></a> <em>areal density</em> (gigabits stored per square inch), whereas transfer speed scales with<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="linear density (magnetic storage)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117337280"></a> <em>linear density</em> (bits per inch). This means that if disk capacity grows by a factor of 4, transfer speed increases by only a factor of 2. Consequently, current data center drives support maximum data transfer speeds of 200–300 MB/s. To frame this another way, it takes more than 20 hours to read the entire contents of a 30 TB magnetic drive, assuming a transfer speed of 300 MB/s.</p>
        
        <p>A second major limitation is seek time. To access data, the drive must physically relocate the read/write heads to the appropriate track on the disk. Third, in order to find a particular piece of data on the disk, the disk controller must wait for that data to rotate under the read/write heads. This leads to<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="rotational latency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117334976"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="latency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117333840"></a> <em>rotational latency</em>. Typical commercial drives spinning at 7,200 revolutions per minute (RPM) seek time, and rotational latency, leads to over four milliseconds of overall average latency (time to access a selected piece of data). A fourth limitation is input/output operations per second (IOPS), critical for transactional databases. A magnetic drive ranges from 50 to 500 IOPS.</p>
        
        <p>Various tricks can improve latency and transfer speed. Using a higher rotational speed can increase transfer rate and decrease rotational latency. Limiting the radius of the disk platter or writing data into only a narrow band on the disk reduces seek time. However, none of these techniques makes magnetic drives remotely competitive with SSDs for random access lookups. SSDs can deliver data with significantly lower latency, higher IOPS, and higher transfer speeds, partially because there is no physically rotating disk or magnetic head to wait for.</p>
        
        <p>As mentioned earlier, magnetic disks are still prized in data centers for their low data-storage costs. In addition, magnetic drives can sustain extraordinarily high transfer rates through parallelism. This is the critical idea behind cloud object storage: data can be distributed across thousands of disks in clusters. Data-transfer rates go up dramatically by reading from numerous disks simultaneously, limited primarily by network performance rather than disk transfer rate. Thus, network components and CPUs are also key raw ingredients in storage systems, and we will return to these topics shortly.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="magdisk06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117330416"></a></p>
        </div></section>
        
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Solid-State Drive"><div class="sect2" id="solid_state_drive">
        <h2>Solid-State Drive</h2>
        
        <p><em>Solid-state drives</em> (SSDs) store<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="solid-state drives (SSDs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117327040"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-tertiary="solid-state drives" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117325936"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="SSDs (solid-state drives)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117324272"></a> data as charges in flash memory cells. SSDs eliminate the mechanical components of magnetic drives; the data is read by purely electronic means. SSDs can look up random data in less than 0.1 ms (100 microseconds). In addition, SSDs can scale both data-transfer speeds and IOPS by slicing storage into partitions with numerous storage controllers running in parallel. Commercial SSDs can support transfer speeds of many gigabytes per second and tens of thousands of IOPS.</p>
        
        <p>Because of these exceptional performance characteristics, SSDs have revolutionized transactional databases and are the accepted standard for commercial deployments of OLTP systems. SSDs allow relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server to handle thousands of transactions per second.</p>
        
        <p>However, SSDs are not currently the default option for high-scale analytics data storage. Again, this comes down to cost. Commercial SSDs typically cost 20–30 cents (USD) per gigabyte of capacity, nearly 10 times the cost per capacity of a magnetic drive. Thus, object storage on magnetic disks has emerged as the leading option for large-scale data storage in data lakes and cloud data warehouses.</p>
        
        <p>SSDs still play a significant role in OLAP systems. Some OLAP databases leverage SSD caching to support high-performance queries on frequently accessed data. As low-latency OLAP becomes more popular, we expect SSD usage in these systems to follow suit.</p>

        <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
        
        <p>We<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-tertiary="random access memory" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117318384"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="random access memory (RAM)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117316736"></a> commonly use the terms <em>random access memory</em> (RAM) and <em>memory</em> interchangeably. Strictly speaking, magnetic drives and SSDs also serve as memory that stores data for later random access retrieval, but RAM has several specific <span class="keep-together">characteristics:</span></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>It is attached to a CPU and mapped into CPU address space.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It stores the code that CPUs execute and the data that this code directly processes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It is <em>volatile</em>, while<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="volatility" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117310208"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117309072"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="NVRAM (nonvolatile random access memory)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117307872"></a> magnetic drives and SSDs are <em>nonvolatile</em>. Though they may occasionally fail and corrupt or lose data, drives generally retain data when powered off. RAM loses data in less than a second when it is unpowered.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It offers significantly higher transfer speeds and faster retrieval times than SSD storage. DDR5 memory—the latest widely used standard for RAM—offers data retrieval latency on the order of 100 ns, roughly 1,000 times faster than SSD. A typical CPU can support 100 GB/s bandwidth to attached memory and millions of IOPS. (Statistics vary dramatically depending on the number of memory channels and other configuration details.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It is significantly more expensive than SSD storage, at roughly $10/GB (at the time of this writing).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It is limited in the amount of RAM attached to an individual CPU and memory controller. This adds further to complexity and cost. High-memory servers typically utilize many interconnected CPUs on one board, each with a block of attached RAM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>It is still significantly slower than CPU cache, a type of memory located directly on the CPU die or in the same package. Cache stores frequently and recently accessed data for ultrafast retrieval during processing. CPU designs incorporate several layers of cache of varying size and performance characteristics.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When we talk about system memory, we almost always mean<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dynamic RAM (DRAM)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117301456"></a> <em>dynamic RAM</em>, a high-density, low-cost form of memory. Dynamic RAM stores data as charges in capacitors. These capacitors leak over time, so the data must be frequently <em>refreshed</em> (read and rewritten) to prevent data loss. The hardware memory controller handles these technical details; data engineers simply need to worry about bandwidth and retrieval latency characteristics. Other forms of memory, such as <em>static RAM</em>, are used in specialized applications such as CPU caches.</p>
        
        <p>Current CPUs virtually always employ the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="von Neumann architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117298384"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="von Neumann architecture" data-primary-sortas="Neumann architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117297216"></a> <em>von Neumann architecture</em>, with code and data stored together in the same memory space. However, CPUs typically also support the option to disable code execution in specific pages of memory for enhanced security. This feature is reminiscent of the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Harvard architecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117295248"></a> <em>Harvard architecture</em>, which separates code and data.</p>
        
        <p>RAM is used in various storage and processing systems and can be used for caching, data processing, or indexes. Several databases treat RAM as a primary storage layer, allowing ultra-fast read and write performance. In these applications, data engineers must always keep in mind the volatility of RAM. Even if data stored in memory is replicated across a cluster, a power outage that brings down several nodes could cause data loss. Architectures intended to durably store data may use battery backups and automatically dump all data to disk in the event of power loss.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Networking and CPU"><div class="sect2" id="networking_and_cpu">
        <h2>Networking and CPU</h2>
        
        <p>Why<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-tertiary="networking and CPU" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117291104"></a> are we mentioning networking and CPU as raw ingredients for storing data? Increasingly, storage systems are distributed to enhance performance, durability, and availability. We mentioned specifically that individual magnetic disks offer relatively low-transfer performance, but a cluster of disks parallelizes reads for significant performance scaling. While storage standards such as redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) parallelize on a single server, cloud object storage clusters operate at a much larger scale, with disks distributed across a network and even multiple data centers and availability zones.</p>
        
        <p><em>Availability zones<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="availability zones" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117288656"></a></em> are a standard cloud construct consisting of compute environments with independent power, water, and other resources. Multizonal storage enhances both the availability and durability of data.</p>
        
        <p>CPUs handle the details of servicing requests, aggregating reads, and distributing writes. Storage becomes a web application with an API, backend service components, and load balancing. Network device performance and network topology are key factors in realizing high performance.</p>
        
        <p>Data engineers need to understand how networking will affect the systems they build and use. Engineers constantly balance the durability and availability achieved by spreading out data geographically versus the performance and cost benefits of keeping storage in a small geographic area and close to data consumers or writers. <a data-type="xref" href="app02.html#b_cloud_networking">Appendix&nbsp;B</a> covers cloud networking and major relevant ideas.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Serialization"><div class="sect2" id="serialization">
        <h2>Serialization</h2>
        
        <p><em>Serialization</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-tertiary="serialization" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117283072"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="serialization" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117281424"></a> another raw storage ingredient and a critical element of database design. The decisions around serialization will inform how well queries perform across a network, CPU overhead, query latency, and more. Designing a data lake, for example, involves choosing a base storage system (e.g., Amazon S3) and standards for serialization that balance interoperability with performance considerations.</p>
        
        <p>What is serialization, exactly? Data stored in system memory by software is generally not in a format suitable for storage on disk or transmission over a network. Serialization is the process of flattening and packing data into a standard format that a reader will be able to decode. Serialization formats provide a standard of data exchange. We might encode data in a row-based manner as an XML, JSON, or CSV file and pass it to another user who can then decode it using a standard library. A serialization algorithm has logic for handling types, imposes rules on data structure, and allows exchange between programming languages and CPUs. The serialization algorithm also has rules for handling exceptions. For instance, Python objects can contain cyclic references; the serialization algorithm might throw an error or limit nesting depth on encountering a cycle.</p>
        
        <p>Low-level database storage is also a form of serialization. Row-oriented relational databases organize data as rows on disk to support speedy lookups and in-place updates. Columnar databases organize data into column files to optimize for highly efficient compression and support fast scans of large data volumes. Each serialization choice comes with a set of trade-offs, and data engineers tune these choices to optimize performance to requirements.</p>
        
        <p>We provide a more detailed catalog of common data serialization techniques and formats in <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#a_serialization_and_compression_technic">Appendix&nbsp;A</a>. We suggest that data engineers become familiar with common serialization practices and formats, especially the most popular current formats (e.g., Apache Parquet), hybrid serialization (e.g., Apache Hudi), and in-memory serialization (e.g., Apache Arrow).</p>
        </div></section>
        
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Compression"><div class="sect2" id="compression">
        <h2>Compression</h2>
        
        <p><em>Compression</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="raw ingredients of data storage" data-tertiary="compression" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117274960"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="compression algorithms" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117273264"></a> another critical component of storage engineering. On a basic level, compression makes data smaller, but compression algorithms interact with other details of storage systems in complex ways.</p>
        
        <p>Highly efficient compression has three main advantages in storage systems. First, the data is smaller and thus takes up less space on the disk. Second, compression increases the practical scan speed per disk. With a 10:1 compression ratio, we go from scanning 200 MB/s per magnetic disk to an effective rate of 2 GB/s per disk.</p>
        
        <p>The third advantage is in network performance. Given that a network connection between an Amazon EC2 instance and S3 provides 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) of bandwidth, a 10:1 compression ratio increases effective network bandwidth to 100 Gbps.</p>
        
        <p>Compression also comes with disadvantages. Compressing and decompressing data entails extra time and resource consumption to read or write data.

The core idea of caching is to store frequently or recently accessed data in a fast access layer. The faster the cache, the higher the cost and the less storage space available. Less frequently accessed data is stored in cheaper, slower storage. Caches are critical for data serving, processing, and transformation.</p>

Most practical data systems rely on many cache layers assembled from storage with varying performance characteristics. This starts inside CPUs; processors may deploy up to four cache tiers.

        <p>Distributed storage coordinates the activities of multiple servers to store, retrieve, and process data faster and at a larger scale, all while providing redundancy in case a server becomes unavailable. Distributed storage is common in architectures where you want built-in redundancy and scalability for large amounts of data. For example, object storage, Apache Spark, and cloud data warehouses rely on distributed storage architectures.</p>

        <h2>Eventual Versus Strong Consistency</h2>
        
        <p>A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="data storage systems" data-tertiary="eventual versus strong consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117218000"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="eventual consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117216256"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strong consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117215152"></a> challenge with distributed systems is that your data is spread across multiple servers. How does this system keep the data consistent? Unfortunately, distributed systems pose a dilemma for storage and query accuracy. It takes time to replicate changes across the nodes of a system; often a balance exists between getting current data and getting “sorta” current data in a distributed database. Let’s look at two common consistency patterns in distributed systems: eventual and strong.</p>
        
        <p>We’ve covered ACID compliance throughout this book, starting in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data_generation_in_source_systems">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>. Another<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="basically available, soft-state, eventual consistency (BASE)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117212448"></a> acronym is <em>BASE</em>, which stands for <em>basically available, soft-state, eventual consistency</em>. Think of it as the opposite of ACID. BASE is the basis of eventual consistency. Let’s briefly explore its components:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Basically available</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Consistency is not guaranteed, but database reads and writes are made on a best-effort basis, meaning consistent data is available most of the time.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Soft-state</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>The state of the transaction is fuzzy, and it’s uncertain whether the transaction is committed or uncommitted.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Eventual consistency</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>At <em>some</em> point, reading data will return consistent values.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>If reading data in an eventually consistent system is unreliable, why use it? Eventual consistency is a common trade-off in large-scale, distributed systems. If you want to scale horizontally (across multiple nodes) to process data in high volumes, then eventually, consistency is often the price you’ll pay. Eventual consistency allows you to retrieve data quickly without verifying that you have the latest version across all nodes.</p>
        
        <p>The opposite of eventual consistency is <em>strong consistency</em>. With strong consistency, the distributed database ensures that writes to any node are first distributed with a consensus and that any reads against the database return consistent values. You’ll use strong consistency when you can tolerate higher query latency and require correct data every time you read from the database.</p>
        
        <p>Generally, data engineers make decisions about consistency in three places. First, the database technology itself sets the stage for a certain level of consistency. Second, configuration parameters for the database will have an impact on consistency. Third, databases often support some consistency configuration at an individual query level. For example, <a href="https://oreil.ly/qJ6z4">DynamoDB</a> supports eventually consistent reads and strongly consistent reads. Strongly consistent reads are slower and consume more resources, so it is best to use them sparingly, but they are available when consistency is required.</p>
        
        <p>You should understand how your database handles consistency. Again, data engineers are tasked with understanding technology deeply and using it to solve problems appropriately. A data engineer might need to negotiate consistency requirements with other technical and business stakeholders. Note that this is both a technology and organizational problem; ensure that you have gathered requirements from your stakeholders and choose your technologies appropriately.</p>

        <h2>File Storage</h2>

A <em>file</em> is a data entity with specific read, write, and reference characteristics used by software and operating systems. We define a file to have the following characteristics:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Finite length</dt>
            <dd class="pagebreak-after">
            <p>A file is a finite-length stream of bytes.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt class="less_space">Append operations</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>We can append bytes to the file up to the limits of the host storage system.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Random access</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>We can read from any location in the file or write updates to any location.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p><em>Object storage</em> behaves<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117188608"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="versus file storage" data-secondary-sortas="file storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117187472"></a> much like file storage but with key differences. While we set the stage for object storage by discussing file storage first, object storage is arguably much more important for the type of data engineering you’ll do today. We will forward-reference the object storage discussion extensively over the next few pages.</p>
        
        <p>File storage systems organize files into a directory tree. The directory reference for a file might look like this:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">/Users/matthewhousley/output.txt</pre>
        
        <p>When this file reference is passed to the operating system, it starts at the root directory <code>/</code>, finds <code>Users</code>, <code>matthewhousley</code>, and finally <code>output.txt</code>. Working from the left, each directory is contained inside a parent directory, until we finally reach the file <code>output.txt</code>. This example uses Unix semantics, but Windows file reference semantics are similar. The filesystem stores each directory as metadata about the files and directories that it contains. This metadata consists of the name of each entity, relevant permission details, and a pointer to the actual entity. To find a file on disk, the operating system looks at the metadata at each hierarchy level and follows the pointer to the next subdirectory entity until finally reaching the file itself.</p>
        
        <p>Note that other file-like data entities generally don’t necessarily have all these properties. For example, <em>objects</em> in object storage support only the first characteristic, finite length, but are still extremely useful. We discuss this in <a data-type="xref" href="#object_storage">“Object Storage”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In cases where file storage paradigms are necessary for a pipeline, be careful with state and try to use ephemeral environments as much as possible. Even if you must process files on a server with an attached disk, use object storage for intermediate storage between processing steps. Try to reserve manual, low-level file processing for one-time ingestion steps or the exploratory stages of pipeline development.</p>

New Technology File System (NTFS) and ext4 are popular filesystems on Windows and Linux, respectively. The operating system handles the details of storing directory entities, files, and metadata. Filesystems are designed to write data to allow for easy recovery in the event of power loss during a write, though any unwritten data will still be lost.</p>
        
        <p>Local filesystems generally support full read after write consistency; reading immediately after a write will return the written data. Operating systems also employ various locking strategies to manage concurrent writing attempts to a file.</p>
        
        <p>Local disk filesystems may also support advanced features such as journaling, snapshots, redundancy, the extension of the filesystem across multiple disks, full disk encryption, and compression. In <a data-type="xref" href="#block_storage">“Block Storage”</a>, we also discuss RAID.</p>

NAS is a prevalent solution for servers; they quite often ship with built-in dedicated NAS interface hardware. While there are performance penalties to accessing the filesystem over a network, significant advantages to storage virtualization also exist, including redundancy and reliability, fine-grained control of resources, storage pooling across multiple disks for large virtual volumes, and file sharing across multiple machines. Engineers should be aware of the consistency model provided by their NAS solution, especially when multiple clients will potentially access the same data.</p>
        
        <p>A popular alternative to NAS is a storage area network (SAN), but SAN systems provide block-level access without the filesystem abstraction. We cover SAN systems in <a data-type="xref" href="#block_storage">“Block Storage”</a>.</p>

Cloud filesystems should not be confused with standard storage attached to VMs—generally, block storage with a filesystem managed by the VM operating system. Cloud filesystems behave much like NAS solutions, but the details of networking, managing disk clusters, failures, and configuration are fully handled by the cloud vendor.</p>
        
        <p>For example, Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is an extremely popular example of a cloud filesystem service. Storage is exposed through the <a href="https://oreil.ly/GhvpT">NFS 4 protocol</a>, which is also used by NAS systems. EFS provides automatic scaling and pay-per-storage pricing with no advanced storage reservation required. The service also provides <em>local</em> read-after-write consistency (when reading from the machine that performed the write). It also offers open-after-close consistency across the full filesystem. In other words, once an application closes a file, subsequent readers will see changes saved to the closed file.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="filestor06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117157536"></a></p>

        <h2>Block Storage</h2>
        
        <p>Fundamentally, <em>block storage</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="data storage systems" data-tertiary="block storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117153216"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="block storage" data-type="indexterm" id="blockstor06"></a> the type of raw storage provided by SSDs and magnetic disks. In the cloud, virtualized block storage is the standard for VMs. These block storage abstractions allow fine control of storage size, scalability, and data durability beyond that offered by raw disks.</p>
        
        <p>In our earlier discussion of SSDs and magnetic disks, we mentioned that with these random-access devices, the operating system can seek, read, and write any data on the disk. A <em>block</em> is the smallest addressable unit of data supported by a disk. This was often 512 bytes of usable data on older disks, but it has now grown to 4,096 bytes for most current disks, making writes less fine-grained but dramatically reducing the overhead of managing blocks. Blocks typically contain extra bits for error detection/correction and other metadata.</p>
        
        <p>Blocks on magnetic disks are geometrically arranged on a physical platter. Two blocks on the same track can be read without moving the head, while reading two blocks on separate tracks requires a seek. Seek time can occur between blocks on an SSD, but this is infinitesimal compared to the seek time for magnetic disk tracks.</p>

        <h3>Block storage applications</h3>
        
        <p>Transactional database systems generally access disks at a block level to lay out data for optimal performance. For row-oriented databases, this originally meant that rows of data were written as continuous streams; the situation has grown more complicated with the arrival of SSDs and their associated seek-time performance improvements, but transactional databases still rely on the high random access performance offered by direct access to a block storage device.</p>
        
        <p>Block storage also remains the default option for operating system boot disks on cloud VMs. The block device is formatted much as it would be directly on a physical disk, but the storage is usually virtualized.

SAN abstraction can allow fine-grained storage scaling and enhance performance, availability, and durability. You might encounter SAN systems if you’re working with on-premises storage systems; you might also encounter a cloud version of SAN, as in the next subsection.</p>

        <h3>Cloud virtualized block storage</h3>
        
        <p><em>Cloud virtualized block storage</em> solutions<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud virtualized block storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117131168"></a> are similar to SAN but free engineers from dealing with SAN clusters and networking details. We’ll look at<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117129744"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Store)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117128624"></a> Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) as a standard example; other public clouds have similar offerings. EBS is the default storage for Amazon EC2 virtual machines; other cloud providers also treat virtualized object storage as a key component of their VM offerings.</p>
        
        <p>EBS offers several tiers of service with different performance characteristics. Generally, EBS performance metrics are given in IOPS and throughput (transfer speed). The higher performance tiers of EBS storage are backed by SSD disks, while magnetic disk-backed storage offers lower IOPS but costs less per gigabyte.</p>
        
        <p>EBS volumes store data separate from the instance host server but in the same zone to support high performance and low latency (<a data-type="xref" href="#ebs_volumes_replicate_data_to_multiple">Figure&nbsp;6-5</a>). This allows EBS volumes to persist when an EC2 instance shuts down, when a host server fails, or even when the instance is deleted. EBS storage is suitable for applications such as databases, where data durability is a high priority. In addition, EBS replicates all data to at least two separate host machines, protecting data if a disk fails.</p>

        <h6><span class="label">Figure 6-5. </span>EBS volumes replicate data to multiple hosts and disks for high durability and availability, but are not resilient to the failure of an availability zone</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>EBS storage virtualization also supports several advanced features. For example, EBS volumes allow instantaneous point-in-time snapshots while the drive is used. Although it still takes some time for the snapshot to be replicated to S3, EBS can effectively freeze the state of data blocks when the snapshot is taken, while allowing the client machine to continue using the disk. In addition, snapshots after the initial full backup are differential; only changed blocks are written to S3 to minimize storage costs and backup time.</p>
        
        <p>EBS volumes are also highly scalable. At the time of this writing, some EBS volume classes can scale up to 64 TiB, 256,000 IOPS, and 4,000 MiB/s.</p>

        <h3>Local instance volumes</h3>

These storage volumes are generally very low cost (included with the price of the VM in the case of Amazon’s EC2 instance store) and provide low latency and high IOPS.</p>
        
        <p>Instance store volumes (<a data-type="xref" href="#instance_store_volumes_offer_high_perfo">Figure&nbsp;6-6</a>) behave essentially like a disk physically attached to a server in a data center. One key difference is that when a VM shuts down or is deleted, the contents of the locally attached disk are lost, whether or not this event was caused by intentional user action. This ensures that a new virtual machine cannot read disk contents belonging to a different customer.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="instance_store_volumes_offer_high_perfo" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0606.png" width="434" height="386">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 6-6. </span>Instance store volumes offer high performance and low cost but do not protect data in the event of disk failure or VM shutdown</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Locally attached disks support none of the advanced virtualization features offered by virtualized storage services like EBS. The locally attached disk is not replicated, so a physical disk failure can lose or corrupt data even if the host VM continues running. Furthermore, locally attached volumes do not support snapshots or other backup features.</p>
        
        <p>Despite these limitations, locally attached disks are extremely useful. In many cases, we use disks as a local cache and hence don’t need all the advanced virtualization features of a service like EBS. For example, suppose we’re running AWS EMR on EC2 instances. We may be running an ephemeral job that consumes data from S3, stores it temporarily in the distributed filesystem running across the instances, processes the data, and writes the results back to S3. The EMR filesystem builds in replication and redundancy and is serving as a cache rather than permanent storage. The EC2 instance store is a perfectly suitable solution in this case and can enhance performance since data can be read and processed locally without flowing over a network (see <a data-type="xref" href="#instance_store_volumes_can_be_used_as_a">Figure&nbsp;6-7</a>).</p>
        
        <figure><div id="instance_store_volumes_can_be_used_as_a" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0607.png" width="600" height="337">

        <p>We recommend that engineers think about locally attached storage in worst-case scenarios. What are the consequences of a local disk failure? Of an accidental VM or cluster shutdown? Of a zonal or regional cloud outage? If none of these scenarios will have catastrophic consequences when data on locally attached volumes is lost, local storage may be a cost-effective and performant option. In addition, simple mitigation strategies (periodic checkpoint backups to S3) can prevent data loss.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="blockstor06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117107664"></a></p>

In this context, we’re talking about a specialized file-like construct. It could be any type of file—TXT, CSV, JSON, images, videos, or audio.</p>

        <h6><span class="label">Figure 6-8. </span>Object storage contains immutable objects of all shapes and sizes. Unlike files on a local disk, objects cannot be modified in place.</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Object stores<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="popularity of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117093984"></a> have grown in importance and popularity with the rise of big data and the cloud. Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) are widely used object stores. In addition, many cloud data warehouses (and a growing number of databases) utilize object storage as their storage layer, and cloud data lakes generally sit on object stores.</p>
        
        <p>Although many on-premises object storage systems can be installed on server clusters, we’ll focus mostly on fully managed cloud object stores. From<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="benefits of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117091504"></a> an operational perspective, one of the most attractive characteristics of cloud object storage is that it is straightforward to manage and use. Object storage was arguably one of the first “serverless” services; engineers don’t need to consider the characteristics of underlying server clusters or disks.</p>
        
        <p>An object store is a key-value store for immutable data objects. We lose much of the writing flexibility we expect with file storage on a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="versus local disk" data-secondary-sortas="local disk" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117089104"></a> local disk in an object store. Objects don’t support random writes or append operations; instead, they are written once as a stream of bytes. After this initial write, objects become immutable. To change data in an object or append data to it, we must rewrite the full object. Object stores generally support random reads through range requests, but these lookups may perform much worse than random reads from data stored on an SSD.</p>
        
        <p>For a software developer used to leveraging local random access file storage, the characteristics of objects might seem like constraints, but less is more; object stores don’t need to support locks or change synchronization, allowing data storage across massive disk clusters. Object stores support extremely performant parallel stream writes and reads across many disks, and this parallelism is hidden from engineers, who can simply deal with the stream rather than communicating with individual disks. In a cloud environment, write speed scales with the number of streams being written up to quota limits set by the vendor. Read bandwidth can scale with the number of parallel requests, the number of virtual machines employed to read data, and the number of CPU cores. These characteristics make object storage ideal for serving high-volume web traffic or delivering data to highly parallel distributed query engines.</p>
        
        <p>Typical cloud object stores save data in several<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="availability zones and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117085040"></a> availability zones, dramatically reducing the odds that storage will go fully offline or be lost in an unrecoverable way. This durability and availability are built into the cost; cloud storage vendors offer other storage classes at discounted prices in exchange for reduced durability or availability. We’ll discuss this in <a data-type="xref" href="#storage_classes_and_tiers">“Storage classes and tiers”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Cloud object storage is a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="benefits of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117082096"></a> key ingredient in separating compute and storage, allowing engineers to process data with ephemeral clusters and scale these clusters up and down on demand. This is a key factor in making big data available to smaller organizations that can’t afford to own hardware for data jobs that they’ll run only occasionally. Some major tech companies will continue to run permanent Hadoop clusters on their hardware. Still, the general trend is that most organizations will move data processing to the cloud, using an object store as essential storage and serving layer while processing data on ephemeral clusters.</p>
        
        <p>In<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="scalability of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117079552"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="scalability" data-secondary="object storage and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117078144"></a> object storage, available storage space is also highly scalable, an ideal characteristic for big data systems. Storage space is constrained by the number of disks the storage provider owns, but these providers handle exabytes of data. In a cloud environment, available storage space is virtually limitless; in practice, the primary limit on storage space for public cloud customers is budget. From a practical standpoint, engineers can quickly store massive quantities of data for projects without planning months in advance for necessary servers and disks.</p>

        <h3>Object stores for data engineering applications</h3>

This corresponds well to the use case for massive OLAP systems. A bit of data engineering folklore says that object stores are not good for updates, but this is only partially true. Object stores are an inferior fit for transactional workloads with many small updates every second; these use cases are much better served by transactional databases or block storage systems. Object stores work well for a low rate of update operations, where each operation updates a large volume of data.</p>
        
        <p>Object stores are now the gold standard of storage for data lakes. In the early days of data lakes, write once, read many (WORM) was the operational standard, but this had more to do with the complexities of managing data versions and files than the limitations of HDFS and object stores. Since then, systems such as Apache Hudi and Delta Lake have emerged to manage this complexity, and privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have made deletion and update capabilities imperative. Update management for object storage is the central idea behind the data lakehouse concept, which we introduced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#designing_good_data_architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Object storage is an ideal repository for unstructured data in any format beyond these structured data applications. Object storage can house any binary data with no constraints on type or structure and frequently plays a role in ML pipelines for raw text, images, video, and audio.</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Object lookup"><div class="sect3" id="object_lookup">
        <h3>Object lookup</h3>
        
        <p>As<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="object lookup" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117065584"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="lookup data" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117064176"></a> we mentioned, object stores are key-value stores. What does this mean for engineers? It’s critical to understand that, unlike file stores, object stores do not utilize a directory tree to find objects. The object store uses a top-level logical container (a bucket in S3 and GCS) and references objects by key. A simple example in S3 might look like this:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">S3://oreilly-data-engineering-book/data-example.json</pre>
        
        <p>In this case, <code>S3://oreilly-data-engineering-book/</code> is the bucket name, and <code>data-example.json</code> is the key pointing to a particular object. S3 bucket names must be unique across all of AWS. Keys are unique within a bucket. Although cloud object stores may appear to support directory tree semantics, no true directory hierarchy exists. We might store an object with the following full path:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">S3://oreilly-data-engineering-book/project-data/11/23/2021/data.txt</pre>
        
        <p>On the surface, this looks like subdirectories you might find in a regular file folder system: <code>project-data</code>, <code>11</code>, <code>23</code>, and <code>2021</code>. Many cloud console interfaces allow users to view the objects inside a “directory,” and cloud command-line tools often support Unix-style commands such as <code>ls</code> inside an object store directory. However, behind the scenes, the object system does not traverse a directory tree to reach the object. Instead, it simply sees a key (<code>project-data/11/23/2021/data.txt</code>) that happens to match directory semantics. This might seem like a minor technical detail, but engineers need to understand that certain “directory”-level operations are costly in an object store. To run <code>aws ls S3://oreilly-data-engineering-book/project-data/11/</code> the object store must filter keys on the key prefix <code>project-data/11/</code>. If the bucket contains millions of objects, this operation might take some time, even if the “subdirectory” houses only a few objects.</p>

        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Object consistency and versioning"><div class="sect3" id="object_consistency_and_versioning">
        <h3>Object consistency and versioning</h3>
        
        <p>As<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="object storage" data-secondary="object consistency and versioning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117052096"></a> mentioned, object stores don’t support in-place updates or appends as a general rule. We write a new object under the same key to update an object. When data engineers utilize updates in data processes, they must be aware of the consistency model for the object store they’re using. Object stores may be eventually consistent or strongly consistent. For example, until recently, S3 was<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117050128"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="eventual consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117048992"></a> <em>eventually consistent</em>; after a new version of an object was written under the same key, the object store might sometimes return the old version of the object. The <em>eventual</em> part of <em>eventual consistency</em> means that after enough time has passed, the storage cluster reaches a state such that only the latest version of the object will be returned. This contrasts with the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="strong consistency" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117046288"></a> <em>strong consistency</em> model we expect of local disks attached to a server: reading after a write will return the most recently written data.</p>
        
        <p>It might be desirable to impose strong consistency on an object store for various reasons, and standard methods are used to achieve this. One approach is to add a strongly consistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to the mix. Writing an object is now a two-step process:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p>Write the object.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Write the returned metadata for the object version to the strongly consistent database.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="version metadata" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117041056"></a> version metadata (an object hash or an object timestamp) can uniquely identify an object version in conjunction with the object key. To read an object, a reader undertakes the following steps:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p>Fetch the latest object metadata from the strongly consistent database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Query object metadata using the object key. Read the object data if it matches the metadata fetched from the consistent database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>If the object metadata does not match, repeat step 2 until the latest version of the object is returned.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>A practical implementation has exceptions and edge cases to consider, such as when the object gets rewritten during this querying process. These steps can be managed behind an API so that an object reader sees a strongly consistent object store at the cost of higher latency for object access.</p>
        
        <p>Object versioning is closely related to object consistency. When we rewrite an object under an existing key in an object store, we’re essentially writing a brand-new object, setting references from the existing key to the object, and deleting the old object references. Updating all references across the cluster takes time, hence the potential for stale reads. Eventually, the storage cluster garbage collector deallocates the space dedicated to the dereferenced data, recycling disk capacity for use by new objects.</p>
        
        <p>With object versioning turned on, we add additional metadata to the object that stipulates a version. While the default key reference gets updated to point to the new object, we retain other pointers to previous versions. We also maintain a version list so that clients can get a list of all object versions, and then pull a specific version. Because old versions of the object are still referenced, they aren’t cleaned up by the garbage collector.</p>
        
        <p>If we reference an object with a version, the consistency issue with some object storage systems disappears: the key and version metadata together form a unique reference to a particular, immutable data object. We will always get the same object back when we use this pair, provided that we haven’t deleted it. The consistency issue still exists when a client requests the “default” or “latest” version of an object.</p>
        
        <p>The principal overhead that engineers need to consider with object versioning is the cost of storage. Historical versions of objects generally have the same associated storage costs as current versions. Object version costs may be nearly insignificant or catastrophically expensive, depending on various factors. The data size is an issue, as is update frequency; more object versions can lead to significantly larger data size. Keep in mind that we’re talking about brute-force object versioning. Object storage systems generally store full object data for each version, not differential snapshots.</p>
        
        <p class="pagebreak-before">Engineers also have the option of deploying storage lifecycle policies. Lifecycle policies allow automatic deletion of old object versions when certain conditions are met (e.g., when an object version reaches a certain age or many newer versions exist). Cloud vendors also offer various archival data tiers at heavily discounted prices, and the archival process can be managed using lifecycle policies.</p>

We use the term <em>reduced access</em> here because many of these storage tiers still make data highly available, but with high retrieval costs in exchange for reduced storage costs.</p>
        
        <p>Let’s look at a couple of examples in S3 since Amazon is a benchmark for cloud service standards. The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117025664"></a> S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class discounts monthly storage costs for increased data retrieval costs. (See <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#a_brief_detour_on_cloud_economics">“A Brief Detour on Cloud Economics”</a> for a theoretical discussion of the economics of cloud storage tiers.) Amazon also offers the Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access tier, replicating only to a single zone. Projected availability drops from 99.9% to 99.5% to account for the possibility of a zonal outage. Amazon still claims extremely high data durability, with the caveat that data will be lost if an availability zone is destroyed.</p>
        
        <p>Further down the tiers of reduced access are the archival tiers in S3 Glacier. S3 Glacier promises a dramatic reduction in long-term storage costs for much higher access costs. Users have various retrieval speed options, from minutes to hours, with higher retrieval costs for faster access. For example, at the time of this writing, S3 Glacier Deep Archive discounts storage costs even further; Amazon advertises that storage costs start at $1 per terabyte per month. In exchange, data restoration takes 12 hours. In addition, this storage class is designed for data that will be stored 7–10 years and be accessed only one to two times per year.</p>
        
        <p>Be aware of how you plan to utilize archival storage, as it’s easy to get into and often costly to access data, especially if you need it more often than expected.

Tools like s3fs and Amazon S3 File Gateway allow users to mount an S3 bucket as local storage. Users of these tools should be aware of the characteristics of writes to the filesystem and how these will interact with the characteristics and pricing of object storage. File Gateway, for example, handles changes to files fairly efficiently by combining portions of objects into a new object using the advanced capabilities of S3. However, high-speed transactional writing will overwhelm the update capabilities of an object store. Mounting object storage as a local filesystem works well for files that are updated infrequently.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ostor06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135117015648"></a></p>

        <h2>The Hadoop Distributed File System</h2>
        
        <p>In the recent past, “Hadoop” was virtually synonymous with “big data.” The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="data storage systems" data-tertiary="Hadoop Distributed File System" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116994544"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116992832"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Google File System (GFS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116991712"></a> Hadoop Distributed File System is based on <a href="https://oreil.ly/GlIic">Google File System (GFS)</a> and was initially engineered to process data with the <a href="https://oreil.ly/DscVp">MapReduce programming model</a>. Hadoop is similar to object storage but with a key difference: Hadoop combines compute and storage on the same nodes, where object stores typically have limited support for internal processing.</p>
        
        <p>Hadoop breaks large files into<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="blocks (HDFS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116988128"></a> <em>blocks</em>, chunks of data less than a few hundred megabytes in size. The filesystem is managed by the <em>NameNode</em>, which maintains directories, file metadata, and a detailed catalog describing the location of file blocks in the cluster. In a typical configuration, each block of data is replicated to three nodes. This increases both the durability and availability of data. If a disk or node fails, the replication factor for some file blocks will fall below 3. The NameNode will instruct other nodes to replicate these file blocks so that they again reach the correct replication factor. Thus, the probability of losing data is very low, barring a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="correlated failure" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116985360"></a> <em>correlated failure</em> (e.g., an asteroid hitting the data center).</p>
        
        <p>Hadoop is not simply a storage system. Hadoop combines compute resources with storage nodes to allow in-place data processing. This was originally achieved using the MapReduce programming model, which we discuss in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#queriescomma_modelingcomma_and_transfor">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Hadoop is dead. Long live Hadoop!"><div class="sect3" id="hadoop_is_deaddot_long_live_hadoopexcla">
        <h3>Hadoop is dead. Long live Hadoop!</h3>
        
        <p>We often see claims that Hadoop is dead. This is only partially true. Hadoop is no longer a hot, bleeding-edge technology. Many Hadoop ecosystem tools such as Apache Pig are now on life support and primarily used to run legacy jobs. The pure MapReduce programming model has fallen by the wayside. HDFS remains widely used in various applications and organizations.</p>
        
        <p>Hadoop still appears in many legacy installations. Many organizations that adopted Hadoop during the peak of the big data craze have no immediate plans to migrate to newer technologies. This is a good choice for companies that run massive (thousand-node) Hadoop clusters and have the resources to maintain on-premises systems effectively. Smaller companies may want to reconsider the cost overhead and scale limitations of running a small Hadoop cluster against migrating to cloud solutions.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, HDFS is a key ingredient of many current big data engines, such as Amazon EMR. In fact, Apache Spark is still commonly run on HDFS clusters. We discuss this in more detail in <a data-type="xref" href="#separation_of_compute_from_storage">“Separation of Compute from Storage”</a>.</p>

        <h2>Streaming Storage</h2>
        
        <p>Streaming data<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="data storage systems" data-tertiary="streaming storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116975296"></a> has different storage requirements than nonstreaming data. In the case of message queues, stored data is temporal and expected to disappear after a certain duration. However, distributed, scalable streaming frameworks like Apache Kafka now allow extremely long-duration streaming data retention. Kafka supports indefinite data retention by pushing old, infrequently accessed messages down to object storage. Kafka competitors (including Amazon Kinesis, Apache Pulsar, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub) also support long data retention.</p>
        
        <p>Closely related to data retention in these systems is the notion of<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="replay" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116972528"></a> replay. <em>Replay</em> allows a streaming system to return a range of historical stored data. Replay is the standard data-retrieval mechanism for streaming storage systems. Replay can be used to run batch queries over a time range or to reprocess data in a streaming pipeline. <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ingestion-id000088">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> covers replay in more depth.</p>
        
        <p>Other storage engines have emerged for real-time analytics applications. In some sense, transactional databases emerged as the first real-time query engines; data becomes visible to queries as soon as it is written. However, these databases have well-known scaling and locking limitations, especially for analytics queries that run across large volumes of data. While scalable versions of row-oriented transactional databases have overcome some of these limitations, they are still not truly optimized for analytics at scale.</p>

        <p>Indexes<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="data storage systems" data-tertiary="indexes, partitioning, and clustering" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116966736"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="indexes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116964992"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="partitioning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116963888"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="clustering" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116962784"></a> provide a map of the table for particular fields and allow extremely fast lookup of individual records. Without indexes, a database would need to scan an entire table to find the records satisfying a <code>WHERE</code> condition.</p>
        
        <p>In most RDBMSs, indexes are used for primary table keys (allowing unique identification of rows) and foreign keys (allowing joins with other tables). Indexes can also be applied to other columns to serve the needs of specific applications. Using indexes, an RDBMS can look up and update thousands of rows per second.</p>
        
        <p>We do not cover transactional database records in depth in this book; numerous technical resources are available on this topic. Rather, we are interested in the evolution away from indexes in analytics-oriented storage systems and some new developments in indexes for analytics use cases.</p>

The growing popularity of MPP systems meant a shift toward parallel processing for significant improvements in scan performance across large quantities of data for analytics purposes. However, these row-oriented MPPs still used indexes to support joins and condition checking.</p>
        
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#raw_ingredients_of_data_storage">“Raw Ingredients of Data Storage”</a>, we discuss<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="columnar serialization" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116953616"></a> columnar serialization. <em>Columnar serialization</em> allows a database to scan only the columns required for a particular query, sometimes dramatically reducing the amount of data read from the disk. In addition, arranging data by column packs similar values next to each other, yielding high-compression ratios with minimal compression overhead. This allows data to be scanned more quickly from disk and over a network.</p>
        
        <p>Columnar databases perform poorly for transactional use cases—i.e., when we try to look up large numbers of individual rows asynchronously. However, they perform extremely well when large quantities of data must be scanned—e.g., for complex data transformations, aggregations, statistical calculations, or evaluation of complex conditions on large datasets.</p>
        
        <p>In the past, columnar databases performed poorly on joins, so the advice for data engineers was to<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="denormalization" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116950208"></a> denormalize data, using wide schemas, arrays, and nested data wherever possible.

        <p>While columnar databases allow for fast scan speeds, it’s still helpful to reduce the amount of data scanned as much as possible. In addition to scanning only data in columns relevant to a query, we can partition a table into multiple subtables by splitting it on a field. It is quite common in analytics and data science use cases to scan over a time range, so date- and time-based partitioning is extremely common. Columnar databases generally support a variety of other partition schemes as well.</p>
        
        <p><em>Clusters</em> allow finer-grained organization of data within partitions. A clustering scheme applied within a columnar database sorts data by one or a few fields, colocating similar values. This improves performance for filtering, sorting, and joining these values.</p>

Snowflake uses an algorithmic approach that attempts to cluster together similar rows. This contrasts the traditional naive approach to partitioning on a single designated field, such as a date. Snowflake specifically looks for values that are repeated in a field across many rows. This allows aggressive <em>pruning</em> of queries based on predicates. For example, a <code>WHERE</code> clause might stipulate the following:</p>
        
        <pre data-code-language="sql" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">WHERE</code> <code class="n">created_date</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="s1">'2022-01-02'</code></pre>
        
        <p>In such a query, Snowflake excludes any micro-partitions that don’t include this date, effectively pruning this data. Snowflake also allows overlapping micro-partitions, potentially partitioning on multiple fields showing significant repeats.</p>
        
        <p>Efficient pruning is facilitated by Snowflake’s metadata database, which stores a description of each micro-partition, including the number of rows and value ranges for fields. At each query stage, Snowflake analyzes micro-partitions to determine which ones need to be scanned. Snowflake uses the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid columnar storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116899056"></a> term <em>hybrid columnar storage</em>,<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn56-marker" href="ch06.html#ch01fn56">2</a></sup> partially referring to the fact that its tables are broken into small groups of rows, even though storage is fundamentally columnar.

We introduced many of these abstractions in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#designing_good_data_architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, and we will revisit them here.</p>
        
        <p>The main types of abstractions we’ll concern ourselves with are those that support data science, analytics, and reporting use cases. These include data warehouse, data lake, data lakehouse, data platforms, and data catalogs. We won’t cover source systems, as they are discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data_generation_in_source_systems">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The storage abstraction you require as a data engineer boils down to a few key considerations:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Purpose and use case</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>You must first identify the purpose of storing the data. What is it used for?</p>

            <dt>Separate storage and compute</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>The trend is toward separating storage and compute, but most systems hybridize separation and colocation. We cover this in <a data-type="xref" href="#separation_of_compute_from_storage">“Separation of Compute from Storage”</a> since it affects purpose, speed, and cost.</p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>You should know that the popularity of separating storage from compute means the lines between OLAP databases and data lakes are increasingly blurring. Major cloud data warehouses and data lakes are on a collision course. In the future, the differences between these two may be in name only since they might functionally and technically be very similar under the hood.</p>

        <p>Data warehouses<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data warehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116893408"></a> are a standard OLAP data architecture. As discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#designing_good_data_architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, the term <em>data warehouse</em> refers to technology platforms (e.g., Google BigQuery and Teradata), an architecture for data centralization, and an organizational pattern within a company. In terms of storage trends, we’ve evolved from building data warehouses atop conventional transactional databases, row-based MPP systems (e.g., Teradata and IBM Netezza), and columnar MPP systems (e.g., Vertica and Teradata Columnar) to cloud data warehouses and data platforms. (See our data warehousing discussion in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#designing_good_data_architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3</a> for more details on MPP systems.)</p>
        
        <p>In practice, cloud data warehouses<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud data warehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116901680"></a> are often used to organize data into a data lake, a storage area for massive amounts of unprocessed raw data, as originally conceived by James Dixon.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="ch01fn57-marker" href="ch06.html#ch01fn57">3</a></sup> Cloud data warehouses can handle massive amounts of raw text and complex JSON documents. The limitation is that cloud data warehouses cannot handle truly unstructured data, such as images, video, or audio, unlike a true data lake. Cloud data warehouses can be coupled with object storage to provide a complete data-lake solution.</p>

        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data lakes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116908544"></a> <em>data lake</em> was originally conceived as a massive store where data was retained in raw, unprocessed form. Initially, data lakes were built primarily on Hadoop systems, where cheap storage allowed for retention of massive amounts of data without the cost overhead of a proprietary MPP system.</p>
        
        <p>The last five years have seen two major developments in the evolution of data lake storage. First, a major migration toward <em>separation of compute and storage</em> has occurred. In practice, this means a move away from Hadoop toward cloud object storage for long-term retention of data. Second, data engineers discovered that much of the functionality offered by MPP systems (schema management; update, merge and delete capabilities) and initially dismissed in the rush to data lakes was, in fact, extremely useful. This led to the notion of the data lakehouse.</p>
        </div></section>

        <h2>The Data Lakehouse</h2>
        
        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data lakehouses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116764560"></a> <em>data lakehouse</em> is an architecture that combines aspects of the data warehouse and the data lake. As it is generally conceived, the lakehouse stores data in object storage just like a lake. However, the lakehouse adds to this arrangement features designed to streamline data management and create an engineering experience similar to a data warehouse. This means robust table and schema support and features for managing incremental updates and deletes. Lakehouses typically also support table history and rollback; this is accomplished by retaining old versions of files and metadata.</p>
        
        <p>A lakehouse system is a metadata and file-management layer deployed with data management and transformation tools. Databricks has heavily promoted the lakehouse concept with Delta Lake, an open source storage management system.</p>
        
        <p>We would be remiss not to point out that the architecture of the data lakehouse is similar to the architecture used by various commercial data platforms, including BigQuery and Snowflake. These systems store data in object storage and provide automated metadata management, table history, and update/delete capabilities. The complexities of managing underlying files and storage are fully hidden from the user.</p>
        
        <p>The key advantage of the data lakehouse over proprietary tools is interoperability. It’s much easier to exchange data between tools when stored in an open file format. Reserializing data from a proprietary database format incurs overhead in processing, time, and cost. In a data lakehouse architecture, various tools can connect to the metadata layer and read data directly from object storage.</p>
        
        <p>It is important to emphasize that much of the data in a data lakehouse may not have a table structure imposed. We can impose data warehouse features where we need them in a lakehouse, leaving other data in a raw or even unstructured format.</p>
        
        <p>The data lakehouse technology is evolving rapidly. A variety of new competitors to Delta Lake have emerged, including Apache Hudi and Apache Iceberg. See <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#a_serialization_and_compression_technic">Appendix&nbsp;A</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>At this point, the notion of the data platform frankly has yet to be fully fleshed out. However, the race is on to create a walled garden of data tools, both simplifying the work of data engineering and generating significant vendor lock-in.</p>

Essentially, data flowing through a topic in the streaming storage system is written out to multiple consumers.</p>
        
        <p>Some of these consumers might be real-time processing systems that generate statistics on the stream. In addition, a batch storage consumer writes data for long-term retention and batch queries. The batch consumer could be AWS Kinesis Firehose, which can generate S3 objects based on configurable triggers (e.g., time and batch size). Systems such as BigQuery ingest streaming data into a streaming buffer. This streaming buffer is automatically reserialized into columnar object storage. The query engine supports seamless querying of both the streaming buffer and the object data to provide users a current, nearly real-time view of the table.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="DEstabs06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116782160"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="SSdengabs06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116865456"></a></p>

Many of these considerations are part of larger trends. For example, data catalogs fit under the trend toward “enterprisey” data engineering and data management. Separation of compute from storage is now largely an accomplished fact in cloud data systems. And data sharing is an increasingly important consideration as businesses adopt data technology.</p>

Strictly speaking, a data catalog is not a top-level data storage abstraction, but it integrates with various systems and abstractions. Data catalogs typically work across operational and analytics data sources, integrate data lineage and presentation of data relationships, and allow user editing of data descriptions.</p>
        
        <p>Data catalogs are often used to provide a central place where people can view their data, queries, and data storage. As a data engineer, you’ll likely be responsible for setting up and maintaining the various data integrations of data pipeline and storage systems that will integrate with the data catalog and the integrity of the data catalog itself.</p>

Data sharing allows data scientists to share data from a sandbox with their collaborators within an organization. Across organizations, data sharing facilitates collaboration between partner businesses. For example, an ad tech company can share advertising data with its customers.</p>
        
        <p>A cloud multitenant environment makes interorganizational collaboration much easier. However, it also presents new security challenges. Organizations must carefully control policies that govern who can share data with whom to prevent accidental exposure or deliberate exfiltration.</p>
        
        <p>Data sharing is a core feature of many cloud data platforms. See <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#data_generation_in_source_systems">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> for a more extensive discussion of data sharing.</p>

What is the file format? Is it structured, semistructured, or unstructured? What data types are expected? How does the data fit into a larger hierarchy? Is it connected to other data through shared keys or other relationships?</p>
        
        <p>Note that schema need not be<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="relational schema" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116700960"></a> <em>relational</em>. Rather, data becomes more useful when we have as much information about its structure and organization. For images stored in a data lake, this schema information might explain the image format, resolution, and the way the images fit into a larger hierarchy.</p>
        
        <p>Schema can function as a sort of Rosetta stone, instructions that tell us how to read the data. Two major schema patterns exist: schema on write and schema on read. <em>Schema on write</em> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="schema on write technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116698448"></a> essentially the traditional data warehouse pattern: a table has an integrated schema; any writes to the table must conform. To support schema on write, a data lake must integrate a schema metastore.</p>
        
        <p>With<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="schema on read technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116696704"></a> <em>schema on read</em>, the schema is dynamically created when data is written, and a reader must determine the schema when reading the data. Ideally, schema on read is implemented using file formats that implement built-in schema information, such as Parquet or JSON. CSV files are notorious for schema inconsistency and are not recommended in this setting.</p>
        
        <p>The principal advantage of schema on write is that it enforces data standards, making data easier to consume and utilize in the future. Schema on read emphasizes flexibility, allowing virtually any data to be written. This comes at the cost of greater difficulty consuming data in the future.</p>

        <p>A<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="big ideas and trends in storage" data-tertiary="separation of compute from storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116692176"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud services" data-secondary="separation of compute from storage" data-type="indexterm" id="CSsepar06"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="compute, separating from storage" data-type="indexterm" id="compsep06"></a> key idea we revisit throughout this book is the separation of compute from storage. This has emerged as a standard data access and query pattern in today’s cloud era. Data lakes, as we discussed, store data in object stores and spin up temporary compute capacity to read and process it. Most fully managed OLAP products now rely on object storage behind the scenes. To understand the motivations for separating compute and storage, we should first look at the colocation of compute and storage.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Colocation of compute and storage"><div class="sect3" id="colocation_of_compute_and_storage">
        <h3>Colocation of compute and storage</h3>
        
        <p>Colocation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="colocation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116685520"></a> of compute and storage has long been a standard method to improve database performance. For transactional databases, data colocation allows fast, low-latency disk reads and high bandwidth. Even when we virtualize storage (e.g., using Amazon EBS), data is located relatively close to the host machine.</p>
        
        <p>The same basic idea applies for analytics query systems running across a cluster of machines. For example, with<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116683488"></a> HDFS and<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MapReduce" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116682240"></a> MapReduce, the standard approach is to locate data blocks that need to be scanned in the cluster, and then push individual <em>map</em> jobs out to these blocks. The data scan and processing for the map step are strictly local. The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary=" reduce step" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116680448"></a> <em>reduce</em> step involves shuffling data across the cluster, but keeping map steps local effectively preserves more bandwidth for shuffling, delivering better overall performance; map steps that filter heavily also dramatically reduce the amount of data to be shuffled.</p>

        <h3>Separation of compute and storage</h3>
        
        <p>If colocation of compute and storage delivers high performance, why the shift toward separation of compute and storage? Several motivations exist.</p>
        
        <section data-type="sect4" data-pdf-bookmark="Ephemerality and scalability"><div class="sect4" id="ephemerality_and_scalability">
        <h4>Ephemerality and scalability</h4>

In general, it’s cheaper to buy and host a server than to rent it from a cloud provider, <em>provided that you’re running it 24 hours a day nonstop for years on end</em>. In practice, workloads vary dramatically, and significant efficiencies are realized with a pay-as-you-go model if servers can scale up and down. This is true for web servers in online retail, and it is also true for big data batch jobs that may run only periodically.</p>
        
        <p>Ephemeral compute resources allow engineers to spin up massive clusters to complete jobs on time and then delete clusters when these jobs are done. The performance benefits of temporarily operating at ultra-high scale can outweigh the bandwidth limitations of object storage.</p>

For example, S3 stores data across multiple zones; if a natural disaster destroys a zone, data is still available from the remaining zones. Having multiple zones available also reduces the odds of a data outage. If resources in one zone go down, engineers can spin up the same resources in a different zone.</p>
        
        <p>The potential for a misconfiguration that destroys data in object storage is still somewhat scary, but simple-to-deploy mitigations are available. Copying data to multiple cloud regions reduces this risk since configuration changes are generally deployed to only one region at a time. Replicating data to multiple storage providers can further reduce the risk.</p>

        <p>The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid separation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116663312"></a> practical realities of separating compute from storage are more complicated than we’ve implied. In practice, we constantly hybridize colocation and separation to realize the benefits of both approaches. This hybridization is typically done in two ways: multitier caching and hybrid object storage.</p>
        
        <p>With<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="caching" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116661632"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multitier caching" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116660496"></a> <em>multitier caching</em>, we utilize object storage for long-term data retention and access but spin up local storage to be used during queries and various stages of data pipelines. Both Google and Amazon offer versions of hybrid object storage (object storage that is tightly integrated with compute).</p>
        
        <p>Let’s look at examples of how some popular processing engines hybridize separation and colocation of storage and compute.</p>

Engineers have the option of referencing both S3 and HDFS as a filesystem. A common pattern is to stand up HDFS on SSD drives, pull from S3, and save data from intermediate processing steps on local HDFS. Doing so can realize significant performance gains over processing directly from S3. Full results are written back to S3 once the cluster completes its steps, and the cluster and HDFS are deleted. Other consumers read the output data directly from S3.</p>

        <p>In<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Apache Spark" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116653088"></a> practice, Spark generally runs jobs on HDFS or some other ephemeral distributed filesystem to support performant storage of data between processing steps.

The<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="dynamic RAM (DRAM)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116651568"></a> problem with owning the infrastructure for running Spark is that dynamic RAM (DRAM) is extremely expensive; by separating compute and storage in the cloud, we can rent large quantities of memory and then release that memory when the job completes.</p>

        <p>Apache Druid<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Apache Druid" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116648480"></a> relies heavily on SSDs to realize high performance.

        <p>Of course, maintaining data durability is still critical, so Druid uses an object store as its durability layer. When data is ingested, it’s processed, serialized into compressed columns, and written to cluster SSDs and object storage. In the event of node failure or cluster data corruption, data can be automatically recovered to new nodes. In addition, the cluster can be shut down and then fully recovered from SSD storage.</p>

Amazon also offers some notion of hybrid object storage through S3 Select, a feature that allows users to filter S3 data directly in S3 clusters before data is returned across the network.</p>
        
        <p>We speculate that public clouds will adopt hybrid object storage more widely to improve the performance of their offerings and make more efficient use of available network resources. Some may be already doing so without disclosing this publicly.</p>
        
        <p>The concept of hybrid object storage underscores that there can still be advantages to having low-level access to hardware rather than relying on someone else’s public cloud. Public cloud services do not expose low-level details of hardware and systems (e.g., data block locations for Colossus), but these details can be extremely useful in performance optimization and enhancement. See our discussion of cloud economics in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#choosing_technologies_across_the_data_e">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

This typically means that a new virtual copy of an object is created (e.g., a new table) without necessarily physically copying the underlying data. Typically, new pointers are created to the raw data files, and future changes to these tables will not be recorded in the old table. For those familiar with the inner workings of object-oriented languages such as Python, this type of “shallow” copying is familiar from other contexts.</p>
        
        <p>Zero-copy cloning is a compelling feature, but engineers must understand its strengths and limitations. For example, cloning an object in a data lake environment and then deleting the files in the original object might also wipe out the new object.</p>
        
        <p>For fully managed object-store-based systems (e.g., Snowflake and BigQuery), engineers need to be extremely familiar with the exact limits of shallow copying. Engineers have more access to underlying object storage in data lake systems such as Databricks—a blessing and a curse. Data engineers should exercise great caution before deleting any raw files in the underlying object store. Databricks and other data lake management technologies sometimes also support a notion of <em>deep copying</em>, whereby all underlying data objects are copied. This is a more expensive process, but also more robust in the event that files are unintentionally lost or deleted.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="compsep06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116593056"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="CSsepar06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116591680"></a></p>

The underlying storage for hot data is suited for fast access and reads, such as SSD or memory. Because of the type of hardware involved with hot data, storing hot data is often the most expensive form of storage. Example use cases for hot data include retrieving product recommendations and product page results. The cost of storing hot data is the highest of these three storage tiers, but retrieval is often inexpensive.</p>
        
        <p>Query results cache is another example of hot data. When a query is run, some query engines will persist the query results in the cache. For a limited time, when the same query is run, instead of rerunning the same query against storage, the query results cache serves the cached results. This allows for much faster query response times versus redundantly issuing the same query repeatedly. In upcoming chapters, we cover query results caches in more detail.</p>

No hard and fast rules indicate how often warm data is accessed, but it’s less than hot data and more than cold data. The major cloud providers offer object storage tiers that accommodate warm data. For example, S3 offers an Infrequently Accessed Tier, and Google Cloud has a similar storage tier called Nearline. Vendors give their models of recommended access frequency, and engineers can also do their cost modeling and monitoring. Storage of warm data is cheaper than hot data, with slightly more expensive retrieval costs.</p>

        <h4>Storage tier considerations</h4>
        
        <p>When<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="data storage lifecycle" data-secondary="storage tier considerations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116559312"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="tiers" data-secondary="storage classes and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116557840"></a> considering the storage tier for your data, consider the costs of each tier. If you store all of your data in<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hot storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116556208"></a> hot storage, all of the data can be accessed quickly. But this comes at a tremendous price! Conversely, if you store all data in<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cold storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116554832"></a> cold storage to save on costs, you’ll certainly lower your storage costs, but at the expense of prolonged retrieval times and high retrieval costs if you need to access data. The storage price goes down from faster/higher performing storage to lower storage.</p>
        
        <p>Cold storage is popular for archiving data. Historically, cold storage involved physical backups and often mailing this data to a third party that would archive it in a literal vault. Cold storage is increasingly popular in the cloud. Every cloud vendor offers a cold data solution, and you should weigh the cost of pushing data into cold storage versus the cost and time to retrieve the data.</p>
        
        <p>Data engineers need to account for spillover from hot to warm/cold storage. Memory is expensive and finite. For example, if hot data is stored in memory, it can be spilled to disk when there’s too much new data to store and not enough memory. Some databases may move infrequently accessed data to warm or cold tiers, offloading the data to either HDD or object storage. The latter is increasingly more common because of the cost-effectiveness of object storage. If you’re in the cloud and using managed services, disk spillover will happen automatically.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re using cloud-based object storage, create<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="automated lifecycle policies" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116551872"></a> automated lifecycle policies for your data. This will drastically reduce your storage costs. For example, if your data needs to be accessed only once a month, move the data to an infrequent access storage tier. If your data is 180 days old and not accessed for current queries, move it to an archival storage tier. In both cases, you can automate the migration of data away <span class="keep-together">from regular object</span> storage, and you’ll save money. That said, consider the retrieval <span class="keep-together">costs—both in time</span> and money—using infrequent or archival style storage tiers. Access and retrieval times and costs may vary depending on the cloud provider. Some cloud providers make it simple and cheap to migrate data into archive storage, but it is costly and slow to retrieve your data.</p>

The expectation was, “we might need this data in the future.” This data hoarding inevitably became unwieldy and dirty, giving rise to data swamps and regulatory crackdowns on data retention, among other consequences and nightmares. Nowadays, data engineers need to consider data retention: what data do you <em>need</em> to keep, and how <em>long</em> should you keep it? Here are some things to think about with data retention.</p>

Of course, value is subjective and depends on what it’s worth to your immediate use case and your broader organization. Is this data impossible to re-create, or can it easily be re-created by querying upstream systems? What’s the impact to downstream users if this data is available versus if it is not?</p>

New data is typically more valuable and frequently accessed than older data. Technical limitations may determine how long you can store data in certain storage tiers. For example, if you store hot data in cache or memory, you’ll likely need to set a<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="time to live (TTL)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116535632"></a><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="TTL (time to live)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116534528"></a> time to live (TTL), so you can expire data after a certain point or persist it to warm or cold storage. Otherwise, your hot storage will become full, and queries against the hot data will suffer from performance lags.</p>

In these situations, the data simply needs to be accessible upon request, even if the likelihood of an access request is low. Other regulations might require you to hold data for only a limited period of time, and you’ll need to have the ability to delete specific information on time and within compliance guidelines. You’ll need a storage and archival data process—along with the ability to search the data—that fits the retention requirements of the particular regulation with which you need to comply. Of course, you’ll want to balance compliance against cost.</p>

        <h2>Single-Tenant Versus Multitenant Storage</h2>
        
        <p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#designing_good_data_architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, we<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="big ideas and trends in storage" data-tertiary="single-tenant versus multitenant storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116517840"></a> covered the trade-offs between single-tenant and multitenant architecture. To recap, with<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="single-tenant storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116515856"></a> <em>single-tenant</em> architecture, each group of tenants (e.g., individual users, groups of users, accounts, or customers) gets its own dedicated set of resources such as networking, compute, and storage. A <em>multitenant</em> architecture<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multitenant storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116513760"></a> inverts this and shares these resources among groups of users. Both architectures are widely used. This section looks at the implications of single-tenant and multitenant storage.</p>
        
        <p>Adopting single-tenant storage means that every tenant gets their dedicated storage. In the example in <a data-type="xref" href="#in_single_tenant_storagecomma_each_tena">Figure&nbsp;6-10</a>, each tenant gets a database. No data is shared among these databases, and storage is totally isolated. An example of using single-tenant storage is that each customer’s data must be stored in isolation and cannot be blended with any other customer’s data. In this case, each customer gets their own database.</p>
        
        <figure><div id="in_single_tenant_storagecomma_each_tena" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0610.png" width="600" height="184">
        <h6><span class="label">Figure 6-10. </span>In single-tenant storage, each tenant gets their own database</h6>
        </div></figure>
        
        <p>Separate data storage implies separate and independent schemas, bucket structures, and everything related to storage. This means you have the liberty of designing each tenant’s storage environment to be uniform or let them evolve however they may. Schema variation across customers can be an advantage and a complication; as always, consider the trade-offs. If each tenant’s schema isn’t uniform across all tenants, this has major consequences if you need to query multiple tenants’ tables to create a unified view of all tenant data.</p>
        
        <p>Multitenant storage allows for the storage of multiple tenants within a single database. For example, instead of the single-tenant scenario where customers get their own database, multiple customers may reside in the same database schemas or tables in a multitenant database. Storing multitenant data means each tenant’s data is stored in the same place (<a data-type="xref" href="#in_this_multitenant_storagecomma_four_t">Figure&nbsp;6-11</a>).</p>
        
        <figure><div id="in_this_multitenant_storagecomma_four_t" class="figure"><img alt="" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098108298/files/assets/fode_0611.png" width="458" height="365">

        <p>You need to be aware of querying both single and multitenant storage, which we cover in more detail in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#queriescomma_modelingcomma_and_transfor">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="SSbig06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116504064"></a></p>

        <p>Storage<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="storage stage" data-secondary="division of responsibilities for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116500816"></a> is at the heart of data engineering infrastructure. You’ll interact with the people who own your IT infrastructure—typically, DevOps, security, and cloud architects. Defining domains of responsibility between data engineering and other teams is critical. Do data engineers have the authority to deploy their infrastructure in an AWS account, or must another team handle these changes? Work with other teams to define streamlined processes so that teams can work together efficiently and quickly.</p>
        
        <p>The division of responsibilities for data storage will depend significantly on the maturity of the organization involved. The data engineer will likely manage the storage systems and workflow if the company is early in its data maturity. If the company is later in its data maturity, the data engineer will probably manage a section of the storage system. This data engineer will also likely interact with engineers on either side of storage—ingestion and transformation.</p>
        
        <p>The data engineer needs to ensure that the storage systems used by downstream users are securely available, contain high-quality data, have ample storage capacity, and perform when queries and transformations are run.</p>

Robust security at rest and in motion with fine-grained data access control allows data to be shared and consumed more widely within a business. The value of data goes up significantly when this is possible.</p>
        
        <p>As always, exercise the principle of least privilege. Don’t give full database access to anyone unless required. This means most data engineers don’t need full database access in practice. Also, pay attention to the column, row, and cell-level access controls in your database. Give users only the information they need and no more.</p>

Make sure the code you write stores the data correctly and doesn’t accidentally cause data, memory leaks, or performance issues. Second, define your storage infrastructure as code and use ephemeral compute resources when it’s time to process your data. Because storage is increasingly distinct from compute, you can automatically spin resources up and down while keeping your data in object storage. This keeps your infrastructure clean and avoids coupling your storage and query layers.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="UNda06" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46135116457120"></a></p>
