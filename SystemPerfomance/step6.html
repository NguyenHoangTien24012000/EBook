        <p class="noindent">CPUs drive all software and are often the first target for systems performance analysis. This chapter explains CPU hardware and software, and shows how CPU usage can be examined in detail to look for performance improvements.</p>
        <p class="noindent">At a high level, system-wide CPU utilization can be monitored, and usage by process or thread can be examined. At a lower level, the code paths within applications and the kernel can be profiled and studied, as well as CPU usage by interrupts. At the lowest level, CPU instruction execution and cycle behavior can be analyzed. Other behaviors can also be investigated, including scheduler latency as tasks wait their turn on CPUs, which degrades performance.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1">6.1 Terminology</h3>
        <p class="noindent">For reference, CPU-related terminology used in this chapter includes the following:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Processor</strong>: The physical chip that plugs into a socket on the system or processor board and contains one or more CPUs implemented as cores or hardware threads.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_035">Core</a></strong>: An independent CPU instance on a <em>multicore processor</em>. The use of cores is a way to scale processors, called <em>chip-level multiprocessing</em> (CMP).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Hardware thread</strong>: A CPU architecture that supports executing multiple threads in parallel on a single core (including Intel’s Hyper-Threading Technology), where each thread is an independent CPU instance. This scaling approach is called <em>simultaneous multithreading</em> (SMT).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>CPU instruction</strong>: A single CPU operation, from its <em>instruction set</em>. There are instructions for arithmetic operations, memory I/O, and control logic.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Logical CPU</strong>: Also called a <em>virtual processor,</em><sup><a id="ch06fn1a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn1">1</a></sup> an operating system CPU instance (a schedulable CPU entity). This may be implemented by the processor as a hardware thread (in which case it may also be called a <em>virtual core</em>), a core, or a single-core processor.</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn1" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn1a">1</a></sup>It is also sometimes called a virtual CPU; however, that term is more commonly used to refer to virtual CPU instances provided by a virtualization technology. See <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Cloud Computing</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Scheduler</strong>: The kernel subsystem that assigns threads to run on CPUs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_141">Run queue</a></strong>: A queue of runnable threads that are waiting to be serviced by CPUs. Modern kernels may use some other data structure (e.g., a red-black tree) to store runnable threads, but we still often use the term run queue.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Other terms are introduced throughout this chapter. The Glossary includes basic terminology for reference, including <em>CPU</em>, <em><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_039">CPU cycle</a></em>, and <em><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_161">stack</a></em>.

        <p class="noindent">The following simple models illustrate some basic principles of CPUs and CPU performance. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4">Section 6.4</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4">Architecture</a>, digs much deeper and includes implementation-specific details.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig01">Figure 6.1</a> shows an example CPU architecture, for a single processor with four cores and eight hardware threads in total. The physical architecture is pictured, along with how it is seen by the operating system.<sup><a id="ch06fn2a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn2">2</a></sup></p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2">6.2.2 CPU Memory Caches</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Processors provide various hardware caches for improving memory I/O performance. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig02">Figure 6.2</a> shows the relationship of cache sizes, which become smaller and faster (a trade-off) the closer they are to the CPU.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig03">Figure 6.3</a> shows a CPU run queue, which is managed by the kernel scheduler.</p>

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">The thread states shown in the figure, ready to run and on-CPU, are covered in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig08">Figure 3.8</a> in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Operating Systems</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The number of software threads that are queued and ready to run is an important performance metric indicating CPU saturation. In this figure (at this instant) there are four, with an additional thread running on-CPU. The time spent waiting on a CPU run queue is sometimes called <em>run-queue latency</em> or <em>dispatcher-queue latency</em>. In this book, the term <em>scheduler latency</em> is often used, as it is appropriate for all schedulers, including those that do not use queues (see the discussion of CFS in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4sec2">Section 6.4.2</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4sec2">Software</a>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">For multiprocessor systems, the kernel typically provides a run queue for each CPU, and aims to keep threads on the same run queue. This means that threads are more likely to keep running on the same CPUs where the CPU caches have cached their data. These caches are described as having <em><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_029">cache warmth</a></em>, and this strategy to keep threads running on the same CPUs is called <em>CPU affinity</em>. On NUMA systems, per-CPU run queues also improve <em>memory locality</em>. This improves performance by keeping threads running on the same memory node (as described in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Memory</a>), and avoids the cost of thread synchronization (mutex locks) for queue operations, which would hurt scalability if the run queue was global and shared among all CPUs.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223"></span>6.3 Concepts</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The following are a selection of important concepts regarding CPU performance, beginning with a summary of processor internals: the CPU clock rate and how instructions are executed. This is background for later performance analysis, particularly for understanding the instructions-per-cycle (IPC) metric.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec1">6.3.1 Clock Rate</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The clock is a digital signal that drives all processor logic. Each CPU instruction may take one or more cycles of the clock (called <em>CPU cycles</em>) to execute. CPUs execute at a particular clock rate; for example, a 4 GHz CPU performs 4 billion clock cycles per second.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Some processors are able to vary their clock rate, increasing it to improve performance or decreasing it to reduce power consumption. The rate may be varied on request by the operating system, or dynamically by the processor itself. The kernel idle thread, for example, can request the CPU to throttle down to save power.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Clock rate is often marketed as the primary feature of a processor, but this can be a little misleading. Even if the CPU in your system appears to be fully utilized (a bottleneck), a faster clock rate may not speed up performance—it depends on what those fast CPU cycles are actually doing. If they are mostly stall cycles while waiting on memory access, executing them more quickly doesn’t actually increase the CPU instruction rate or workload throughput.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec2">6.3.2 Instructions</h4>
        <p class="noindent">CPUs execute instructions chosen from their instruction set. An instruction includes the following steps, each processed by a component of the CPU called a <em>functional unit</em>:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="number">Instruction fetch</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Instruction decode</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Execute</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Memory access</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Register write-back</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noindent">The last two steps are optional, depending on the instruction. Many instructions operate on registers only and do not require the memory access step.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Each of these steps takes at least a single clock cycle to be executed. Memory access is often the slowest, as it may take dozens of clock cycles to read or write to main memory, during which instruction execution has <em>stalled</em> (and these cycles while stalled are called <em>stall cycles</em>). This is why CPU caching is important, as described in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4sec1">Section 6.4.1</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4sec1">Hardware</a>: it can dramatically reduce the number of cycles needed for memory access.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224"></span>6.3.3 Instruction Pipeline</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The instruction pipeline is a CPU architecture that can execute multiple instructions in parallel by executing different components of different instructions at the same time. It is similar to a factory assembly line, where stages of production can be executed in parallel, increasing throughput.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Consider the instruction steps previously listed. If each were to take a single clock cycle, it would take five cycles to complete the instruction. At each step of this instruction, only one functional unit is active and four are idle. By use of pipelining, multiple functional units can be active at the same time, processing different instructions in the pipeline. Ideally, the processor can then complete one instruction with every clock cycle.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Instruction pipelining may involve breaking down an instruction into multiple simple steps for execution in parallel. (Depending on the processor, these steps may become simple operations called <em>micro-operations</em> (uOps) for execution by a processor area called the <em>back-end</em>. The <em>front-end</em> of such a processor is responsible for fetching instructions and branch prediction.)</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_1">Branch Prediction</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Modern processors can perform out-of-order execution of the pipeline, where later instructions can be completed while earlier instructions are stalled, improving instruction throughput. However, conditional branch instructions pose a problem. Branch instructions jump execution to a different instruction, and conditional branches do so based on a test. With conditional branches, the processor does not know what the later instructions will be. As an optimization, processors often implement <em>branch prediction</em>, where they will guess the outcome of the test and begin processing the outcome instructions. If the guess later proves to be wrong, the progress in the instruction pipeline must be discarded, hurting performance. To improve the chances of guessing correctly, programmers can place hints in the code (e.g., likely() and unlikely() macros in the Linux Kernel sources).</p>

        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec4">6.3.4 Instruction Width</h4>
        <p class="noindent">But we can go faster still. Multiple functional units of the same type can be included, so that even more instructions can make forward progress with each clock cycle. This CPU architecture is called <em>superscalar</em> and is typically used with pipelining to achieve a high instruction throughput.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The instruction <em>width</em> describes the target number of instructions to process in parallel. Modern processors are <em>3-wide</em> or <em>4-wide</em>, meaning they can complete up to three or four instructions per cycle. How this works depends on the processor, as there may be different numbers of functional units for each stage.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec5">6.3.5 Instruction Size</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Another instruction characteristic is the instruction <em>size</em>: for some processor architectures it is variable: For example, x86, which is classified as a <em>complex instruction set computer</em> (CISC), allows up to 15-byte instructions. ARM, which is a <em>reduced instruction set computer</em> (RISC), has 4 byte instructions with 4-byte alignment for AArch32/A32, and 2- or 4-byte instructions for ARM Thumb.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_225"></span>6.3.6 SMT</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Simultaneous multithreading makes use of a superscalar architecture and hardware multithreading support (by the processor) to improve parallelism. It allows a CPU core to run more than one thread, effectively scheduling between them during instructions, e.g., when one instruction stalls on memory I/O. The kernel presents these hardware threads as virtual CPUs, and schedules threads and processes on them as usual. This was introduced and pictured in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev2sec1">Section 6.2.1</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev2sec1">CPU Architecture</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An example implementation is Intel’s Hyper-Threading Technology, where each core often has two hardware threads. Another example is POWER8, which has eight hardware threads per core.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The performance of each hardware thread is not the same as a separate CPU core, and depends on the workload. To avoid performance problems, kernels may spread out CPU load across cores so that only one hardware thread on each core is busy, avoiding hardware thread contention. Workloads that are stall cycle-heavy (low IPC) may also have better performance than those that are instruction-heavy (high IPC) because stall cycles reduce core contention.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec7">6.3.7 IPC, CPI</h4>
        <p class="noindent"><em>Instructions per cycle</em> (IPC) is an important high-level metric for describing how a CPU is spending its clock cycles and for understanding the nature of CPU utilization. This metric may also be expressed as <em>cycles per instruction</em> (CPI), the inverse of IPC. IPC is more often used by the Linux community and by the Linux perf(1) profiler, and CPI more often used by Intel and elsewhere.<sup><a id="ch06fn3a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn3">3</a></sup></p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn3" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn3a">3</a></sup>In the first edition of this book I used CPI; I’ve since switched to working more on Linux, including switching to IPC.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A low IPC indicates that CPUs are often stalled, typically for memory access. A high IPC indicates that CPUs are often not stalled and have a high instruction throughput. These metrics suggest where performance tuning efforts may be best spent.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Memory-intensive workloads, for example, may be improved by installing faster memory (DRAM), improving memory locality (software configuration), or reducing the amount of memory I/O. Installing CPUs with a higher clock rate may not improve performance to the degree expected, as the CPUs may need to wait the same amount of time for memory I/O to complete. Put differently, a faster CPU may mean more stall cycles but the same rate of completed instructions per second.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The actual values for high or low IPC are dependent on the processor and processor features and can be determined experimentally by running known workloads. As an example, you may find that low-IPC workloads run with an IPC at 0.2 or lower, and high IPC workloads run with an IPC of over 1.0 (which is possible due to instruction pipelining and width, described earlier). At Netflix, cloud workloads range from an IPC of 0.2 (considered slow) to 1.5 (considered good). Expressed as CPI, this range is 5.0 to 0.66.</p>
        <p class="noindent">It should be noted that IPC shows the efficiency of instruction <em>processing</em>, but not of the instructions themselves. Consider a software change that added an inefficient software loop, which operates mostly on CPU registers (no stall cycles): such a change may result in a higher overall IPC, but also higher CPU usage and utilization.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec8"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226"></span>6.3.8 Utilization</h4>
        <p class="noindent">CPU utilization is measured by the time a CPU instance is busy performing work during an interval, expressed as a percentage. It can be measured as the time a CPU is not running the kernel idle thread but is instead running user-level application threads or other kernel threads, or processing interrupts.</p>
        <p class="noindent">High CPU utilization may not necessarily be a problem, but rather a sign that the system is doing work. Some people also consider this a return of investment (ROI) indicator: a highly utilized system is considered to have good ROI, whereas an idle system is considered wasted. Unlike with other resource types (disks), performance does not degrade steeply under high utilization, as the kernel supports priorities, preemption, and time sharing. These together allow the kernel to understand what has higher priority, and to ensure that it runs first.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The measure of CPU utilization spans all clock cycles for eligible activities, including memory stall cycles. This can be misleading: a CPU may be highly utilized because it is often stalled waiting for memory I/O, not just executing instructions, as described in the previous section. This is the case for the Netflix cloud, where the CPU utilization is mostly memory stall cycles <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref20">[Gregg 17b]</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">CPU utilization is often split into separate kernel- and user-time metrics.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The CPU time spent executing user-level software is called <em>user time</em>, and kernel-level software is <em>kernel time</em>. Kernel time includes time during system calls, kernel threads, and interrupts. When measured across the entire system, the user time/kernel time ratio indicates the type of workload performed.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Applications that are computation-intensive may spend almost all their time executing user-level code and have a user/kernel ratio approaching 99/1. Examples include image processing, machine learning, genomics, and data analysis.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Applications that are I/O-intensive have a high rate of system calls, which execute kernel code to perform the I/O. For example, a web server performing network I/O may have a user/kernel ratio of around 70/30.</p>
        <p class="noindent">These numbers are dependent on many factors and are included to express the kinds of ratios expected.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec10">6.3.10 Saturation</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A CPU at 100% utilization is <em>saturated</em>, and threads will encounter <em>scheduler latency</em> as they wait to run on-CPU, decreasing overall performance. This latency is the time spent waiting on the CPU run queue or other structure used to manage threads.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another form of CPU saturation involves CPU resource controls, as may be imposed in a multi-tenant cloud computing environment. While the CPU may not be 100% utilized, the imposed limit has been reached, and threads that are runnable must wait their turn. How visible this is to users of the system depends on the type of virtualization in use; see <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Cloud Computing</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227"></span>A CPU running at saturation is less of a problem than other resource types, as higher-priority work can preempt the current thread.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec11">6.3.11 Preemption</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Preemption, introduced in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Operating Systems</a>, allows a higher-priority thread to preempt the currently running thread and begin its own execution instead. This eliminates the run-queue latency for higher-priority work, improving its performance.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec12">6.3.12 Priority Inversion</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Priority inversion occurs when a lower-priority thread holds a resource and blocks a higher-priority thread from running. This reduces the performance of the higher-priority work, as it is blocked waiting.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This can be solved using a <em>priority inheritance</em> scheme. Here is an example of how this can work (based on a real-world case):</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="number">Thread A performs monitoring and has a low priority. It acquires an address space lock for a production database, to check memory usage.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Thread B, a routine task to perform compression of system logs, begins running.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">There is insufficient CPU to run both. Thread B preempts A and runs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Thread C is from the production database, has a high priority, and has been sleeping waiting for I/O. This I/O now completes, putting thread C back into the runnable state.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Thread C preempts B, runs, but then blocks on the address space lock held by thread A. Thread C leaves CPU.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">The scheduler picks the next-highest-priority thread to run: B.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">With thread B running, a high-priority thread, C, is effectively blocked on a lower-priority thread, B. This is priority inversion.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Priority inheritance gives thread A thread C’s high priority, preempting B, until it releases the lock. Thread C can now run.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noindent">Linux since 2.6.18 has provided a user-level mutex that supports priority inheritance, intended for real-time workloads <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref8">[Corbet 06a]</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec13">6.3.13 Multiprocess, Multithreading</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Most processors provide multiple CPUs of some form. For an application to make use of them, it needs separate threads of execution so that it can run in parallel. For a 64-CPU system, for example, this may mean that an application can execute up to 64 times faster if it can make use of all CPUs in parallel, or handle 64 times the load. The degree to which the application can effectively scale with an increase in CPU count is a measure of <em>scalability</em>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The two techniques to scale applications across CPUs are <em>multiprocess</em> and <em>multithreading</em>, which are pictured in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig04">Figure 6.4</a>.

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec14">6.3.14 Word Size</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Processors are designed around a maximum <em>word size</em>—32-bit or 64-bit—which is the integer size and register size. Word size is also commonly used, depending on the processor, for the address space size and data path width (where it is sometimes called the <em>bit width</em>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Larger sizes can mean better performance, although it’s not as simple as it sounds. Larger sizes may cause memory overheads for unused bits in some data types. The data footprint also increases when the size of pointers (word size) increases, which can require more memory I/O. For the x86 64-bit architecture, these overheads are compensated by an increase in registers and a more efficient register calling convention, so 64-bit applications will likely be faster than their 32-bit versions.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Processors and operating systems can support multiple word sizes and can run applications compiled for different word sizes simultaneously. If software has been compiled for the smaller word size, it may execute successfully but perform relatively poorly.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev3sec15">6.3.15 Compiler Optimization</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The CPU runtime of applications can be significantly improved through compiler options (including setting the word size) and optimizations. Compilers are also frequently updated to take advantage of the latest CPU instruction sets and to implement other optimizations. Sometimes application performance can be significantly improved simply by using a newer compiler.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The <em>control unit</em> is the heart of the CPU, performing instruction fetch, decoding, managing execution, and storing results.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This example processor depicts a shared floating-point unit and (optional) shared Level 3 cache. The actual components in your processor will vary depending on its type and model. Other performance-related components that may be present include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>P-cache</strong>: Prefetch cache (per CPU core)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>W-cache</strong>: Write cache (per CPU core)</p></li>

        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Timestamp counter</strong>: For high-resolution time, incremented by the clock</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Microcode ROM</strong>: Quickly converts instructions to circuit signals</p></li>

        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Network interfaces</strong>: If present on-chip (for high performance)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Some processor types use the temperature sensors as input for dynamic overclocking of individual cores (including Intel Turbo Boost technology), increasing the clock rate while the core remains in its temperature envelope. The possible clock rates can be defined by P-states.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The <em>advanced configuration and power interface</em> (ACPI) standard, in use by Intel processors, defines <em>processor performance states</em> (P-states) and <em>processor power states</em> (C-states) <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref19">[ACPI 17]</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">P-states provide different levels of performance during normal execution by varying the CPU frequency: P0 is the highest frequency (for some Intel CPUs this is the highest “turbo boost” level) and P1...N are lower-frequency states. These states can be controlled by both hardware (e.g., based on the processor temperature) or via software (e.g., kernel power saving modes). The current operating frequency and available states can be observed using model-specific registers (MSRs) (e.g., using the showboost(8) tool in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec10">Section 6.6.10</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec10">showboost</a>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">C-states provide different idle states for when execution is halted, saving power. The C-states are shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06tab02">Table 6.2</a>: C0 is for normal operation, and C1 and above are for idle states: the higher the number, the deeper the state.</p>

These improve memory performance by using faster memory types for caching reads and buffering writes.

        <p class="noindent">The <em>E</em> in E$ originally stood for <em>external</em> cache, but with the integration of Level 2 caches it has since been cleverly referred to as <em>embedded</em> cache. The “Level” terminology is used nowadays instead of the “E$”-style notation, which avoids such confusion.</p>
        <p class="noindent">It is often desirable to refer to the last cache before main memory, which may or may not be level 3. Intel uses the term <em>last-level cache</em> (LLC) for this, also described as the <em>longest-latency cache</em>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The caches available on each processor depend on its type and model. Over time, the number and sizes of these caches have been increasing.

        <p class="noindent">For multicore and multithreading processors, some caches may be shared between cores and threads. For the examples in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06tab03">Table 6.3</a>, all processors since the Intel Xeon 7460 (2008) have multiple Level 1 and Level 2 caches, typically one for each core (the sizes in the table refer to the per-core cache, not the total size).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Apart from the increasing number and sizes of CPU caches, there is also a trend toward providing these on-chip, where access latency can be minimized, instead of providing them externally to the processor.</p>
        <section>
        <h6 class="h6">Latency</h6>
        <p class="noindent">Multiple levels of cache are used to deliver the optimum configuration of size and latency. The access time for the Level 1 cache is typically a few CPU clock cycles, and for the larger Level 2 cache around a dozen clock cycles. Main memory access can take around 60 ns (around 240 cycles for a 4 GHz processor), and address translation by the MMU also adds latency.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The CPU cache latency characteristics for your processor can be determined experimentally using micro-benchmarking <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref10">[Ruggiero 08]</a>. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig07">Figure 6.7</a> shows the result of this, plotting memory access latency for an Intel Xeon E5620 2.4 GHz tested over increasing ranges of memory using LMbench <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref15">[McVoy 12]</a>.</p>

        <h6 class="h6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234"></span>Associativity</h6>
        <p class="noindent">Associativity is a cache characteristic describing a constraint for locating new entries in the cache. Types are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Fully associative</strong>: The cache can locate new entries anywhere. For example, a least recently used (LRU) algorithm could be used for eviction across the entire cache.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Direct mapped</strong>: Each entry has only one valid location in the cache, for example, a hash of the memory address, using a subset of the address bits to form an address in the cache.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Set associative</strong>: A subset of the cache is identified by mapping (e.g., hashing) from within which another algorithm (e.g., LRU) may be performed. It is described in terms of the subset size; for example, <em>four-way set associative</em> maps an address to four possible locations, and then picks the best from those four (e.g., the least recently used location).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">CPU caches often use set associativity as a balance between fully associative (which is expensive to perform) and direct mapped (which has poor hit rates).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h6 class="h6">Cache Line</h6>
        <p class="noindent">Another characteristic of CPU caches is their <em>cache line</em> size. This is a range of bytes that are stored and transferred as a unit, improving memory throughput. A typical cache line size for x86 processors is 64 bytes. Compilers take this into account when optimizing for performance. Programmers sometimes do as well; see Hash Tables in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Applications</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev2sec5">Section 5.2.5</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev2sec5">Concurrency and Parallelism</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h6 class="h6">Cache Coherency</h6>
        <p class="noindent">Memory may be cached in multiple CPU caches on different processors at the same time. When one CPU modifies memory, all caches need to be aware that their cached copy is now <em>stale</em> and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"></span>should be discarded, so that any future reads will retrieve the newly modified copy. This process, called <em>cache coherency</em>, ensures that CPUs are always accessing the correct state of memory.</p>
        <p class="noindent">One of the effects of cache coherency is LLC access penalties. The following examples are provided as a rough guide (these are from <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref12">[Levinthal 09]</a>):</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">LLC hit, line unshared: ~40 CPU cycles</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">LLC hit, line shared in another core: ~65 CPU cycles</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">LLC hit, line modified in another core: ~75 CPU cycles</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Cache coherency is one of the greatest challenges in designing scalable multiprocessor systems, as memory can be modified rapidly.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A generic MMU is pictured in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig08">Figure 6.8</a>, along with CPU cache types. This MMU uses an on-chip translation lookaside buffer (TLB) to cache address translations. Cache misses are satisfied by translation tables in main memory (DRAM), called <em>page tables</em>, which are read directly by the MMU (hardware) and maintained by the kernel.</p>
        <p class="noindent">These factors are processor-dependent. Some (older) processors handle TLB misses using kernel software to walk the page tables, and then populate the TLB with the requested mappings. Such software may maintain its own, larger, in-memory cache of translations, called the <em>translation storage buffer</em> (TSB). Newer processors can service TLB misses in hardware, greatly reducing their cost.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_6">Interconnects</h5>
        <p class="noindent">For multiprocessor architectures, processors are connected using either a shared system bus or a dedicated interconnect. This is related to the memory architecture of the system, uniform memory access (UMA) or NUMA, as discussed in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Memory</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A shared system bus, called the <em>front-side bus</em>, used by earlier Intel processors is illustrated by the four-processor example in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig09">Figure 6.9</a>.</p>
        <figure class="image-c" id="ch06fig09">

        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">The use of a system bus has scalability problems when the processor count is increased, due to contention for the shared bus resource. Modern servers are typically multiprocessor, NUMA, and use a CPU interconnect instead.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Interconnects can connect components other than processors, such as I/O controllers. Example interconnects include Intel’s Quick Path Interconnect (QPI), Intel’s Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI), AMD’s HyperTransport (HT), ARM’s CoreLink Interconnects (there are three different types), and IBM’s Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI). An example Intel QPI architecture for a four-processor system is shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig10">Figure 6.10</a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">To explain how transfer rates can relate to bandwidth, I will explain the QPI example, which is for a 3.2 GHz clock. QPI is <em>double-pumped</em>, performing a data transfer on both rising and falling edges of the clock.<sup><a id="ch06fn4a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn4">4</a></sup> This doubles the transfer rate (3.2 GHz × 2 = 6.4 GT/s). The final bandwidth of 25.6 Gbytes/s is for both send and receive directions (6.4 GT/s × 2 byte width × 2 directions = 25.6 Gbytes/s).</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn4" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn4a">4</a></sup>There is also <em>quad-pumped</em>, where data is transferred on the rising edge, peak, falling edge, and trough of the clock cycle. Quad pumping is used by the Intel FSB.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An interesting detail of QPI is that its cache coherency mode could be tuned in the BIOS, with options including Home Snoop to optimize for memory bandwidth, Early Snoop to optimize for memory latency, and Directory Snoop to improve scalability (it involves tracking what is shared). UPI, which is replacing QPI, only supports Directory Snoop.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Apart from external interconnects, processors have internal interconnects for core communication.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Interconnects are typically designed for high bandwidth, so that they do not become a systemic bottleneck. If they do, performance will degrade as CPU instructions encounter stall cycles for operations that involve the interconnect, such as remote memory I/O. A key indicator for this is a drop in IPC. CPU instructions, cycles, IPC, stall cycles, and memory I/O can be analyzed using CPU performance counters.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_7">Hardware Counters (PMCs)</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Performance monitoring counters (PMCs) were summarized as a source of observability statistics in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Observability Tools</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev3sec9">Section 4.3.9</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev3sec9">Hardware Counters (PMCs)</a>. This section describes their CPU implementation in more detail, and provides additional examples.</p>
        <p class="noindent">PMCs are processor registers implemented in hardware that can be programmed to count low-level CPU activity. They typically include counters for the following:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>CPU cycles</strong>: Including stall cycles and types of stall cycles</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>CPU instructions</strong>: Retired (executed)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Level 1, 2, 3 cache accesses</strong>: Hits, misses</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238"></span><strong>Floating-point unit</strong>: Operations</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Memory I/O</strong>: Reads, writes, stall cycles</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Resource I/O</strong>: Reads, writes, stall cycles</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Each CPU has a small number of registers, usually between two and eight, that can be programmed to record events like these. Those available depend on the processor type and model and are documented in the processor manual.</p>
        <p class="noindent">As a relatively simple example, the Intel P6 family of processors provide performance counters via four model-specific registers (MSRs). Two MSRs are the counters and are read-only. The other two MSRs, called <em>event-select</em> MSRs, are used to program the counters and are read-write. The performance counters are 40-bit registers, and the event-select MSRs are 32-bit. The format of the event-select MSRs is shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig11">Figure 6.11</a>.</p>

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">The counter is identified by the event select and the UMASK. The event select identifies the type of event to count, and the UMASK identifies subtypes or groups of subtypes. The OS and USR bits can be set so that the counter is incremented only while in kernel mode (OS) or user mode (USR), based on the processor protection rings. The CMASK can be set to a threshold of events that must be reached before the counter is incremented.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The Intel processor manual (volume 3B <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref27">[Intel 19b]</a>) lists the dozens of events that can be counted by their event-select and UMASK values. The selected examples in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06tab05">Table 6.5</a> provide an <em>idea</em> of the different targets (processor functional units) that may be observable, including descriptions from the manual.

        <p class="noindent">Graphics processing units (GPUs) were created to support graphical displays, and are now finding use in other workloads including artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, image processing, and cryptocurrency mining. For servers and cloud instances, a GPU is a processor-like resource that can execute a portion of a workload, called the <em>compute kernel</em>, that is suited to highly parallel data processing such as matrix transformations. General-purpose GPUs from Nvidia using its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) have seen widespread adoption. CUDA provides APIs and software libraries for using Nvidia GPUs.</p>
        <p class="noindent">While a processor (CPU) may contain a dozen cores, a GPU may contain hundreds or thousands of smaller cores called <em>streaming processors</em> (SPs),<sup><a id="ch06fn5a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn5">5</a></sup> which each can execute a thread<em>.</em> Since GPU workloads are highly parallel, threads that can execute in parallel are grouped into <em>thread blocks,</em> where they may cooperate among themselves. These thread blocks may be executed by groups of SPs called <em>streaming multiprocessors</em> (SMs) that also provide other resources including a memory cache. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06tab06">Table 6.6</a> further compares processors (CPUs) with GPUs <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref24">[Ather 19]</a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">These functions are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Time sharing</strong>: Multitasking between runnable threads, executing those with the highest priority first.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Preemption</strong>: For threads that have become runnable at a high priority, the scheduler can preempt the currently running thread, so that execution of the higher-priority thread can begin immediately.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Load balancing</strong>: Moving runnable threads to the run queues of idle or less-busy CPUs.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig12">Figure 6.12</a> shows run queues, which is how scheduling was originally implemented. The term and mental model are still used to describe waiting tasks. However, the Linux CFS scheduler actually uses a red/black tree of future task execution.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242"></span>In Linux, time sharing is driven by the system timer interrupt by calling scheduler_tick(), which calls scheduler class functions to manage priorities and the expiration of units of CPU time called <em>time slices</em>. Preemption is triggered when threads become runnable and the scheduler class check_preempt_curr() function is called. Thread switching is managed by __schedule(), which selects the highest-priority thread via pick_next_task() for running. Load balancing is performed by the load_balance() function.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The Linux scheduler also uses logic to avoid migrations when the cost is expected to exceed the benefit, preferring to leave busy threads running on the same CPU where the CPU caches should still be warm (CPU affinity). In the Linux source, see the idle_balance() and task_hot() functions.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Note that all these function names may change; refer to the Linux source code, including documentation in the Documentation directory, for more detail.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Scheduling classes manage the behavior of runnable threads, specifically their priorities, whether their on-CPU time is <em>time-sliced</em>, and the duration of those <em>time slices</em> (also known as <em>time quanta</em>). There are also additional controls via scheduling <em>policies</em>, which may be selected within a scheduling class and can control scheduling between threads of the same priority. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig13">Figure 6.13</a> depicts them for Linux along with the thread priority range.</p>

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">The priority of user-level threads is affected by a user-defined <em>nice</em> value, which can be set to lower the priority of unimportant work (so as to be <em>nice</em> to other system users). In Linux, the nice value sets the <em>static priority</em> of the thread, which is separate from the <em>dynamic priority</em> that the scheduler calculates.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For Linux kernels, the scheduling classes are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>RT</strong>: Provides fixed and high priorities for real-time workloads. The kernel supports both user- and kernel-level preemption, allowing RT tasks to be dispatched with low latency. The priority range is 0–99 (MAX_RT_PRIO-1).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_243"></span><strong>O(1)</strong>: The O(1) scheduler was introduced in Linux 2.6 as the default time-sharing scheduler for user processes. The name comes from the algorithm complexity of O(1) (see <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Applications</a>, for a summary of big O notation). The prior scheduler contained routines that iterated over all tasks, making it O(n), which became a scalability issue. The O(1) scheduler dynamically improved the priority of I/O-bound over CPU-bound workloads, to reduce the latency of interactive and I/O workloads.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>CFS</strong>: Completely fair scheduling was added to the Linux 2.6.23 kernel as the default time-sharing scheduler for user processes. The scheduler manages tasks on a red-black tree keyed from the task CPU time, instead of traditional run queues. This allows low CPU consumers to be easily found and executed in preference to CPU-bound workloads, improving the performance of interactive and I/O-bound workloads.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Idle</strong>: Runs threads with the lowest possible priority.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Deadline</strong>: Added to Linux 3.14, applies earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling using three parameters: <em>runtime</em>, <em>period</em>, and <em>deadline</em>. A task should receive runtime microseconds of CPU time every period microseconds, and do so within the deadline.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">To select a scheduling class, user-level processes select a <em>scheduling policy</em> that maps to a class, using either the sched_setscheduler(2) syscall or the chrt(1) tool.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Scheduler policies are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>RR</strong>: SCHED_RR is round-robin scheduling. Once a thread has used its time quantum, it is moved to the end of the run queue for that priority level, allowing others of the same priority to run. Uses the RT scheduling class.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>FIFO</strong>: SCHED_FIFO is first-in, first-out scheduling, which continues running the thread at the head of the run queue until it voluntarily leaves, or until a higher-priority thread arrives. The thread continues to run, even if other threads of the same priority are on the run queue. Uses the RT class.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>NORMAL</strong>: SCHED_NORMAL (previously known as SCHED_OTHER) is time-sharing scheduling and is the default for user processes. The scheduler dynamically adjusts priority based on the scheduling class. For O(1), the time slice duration is set based on the static priority: longer durations for higher-priority work. For CFS, the time slice is dynamic. Uses the CFS scheduling class.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>BATCH</strong>: SCHED_BATCH is similar to SCHED_NORMAL, but with the expectation that the thread will be CPU-bound and should not be scheduled to interrupt other I/O-bound interactive work. Uses the CFS scheduling class.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>IDLE</strong>: SCHED_IDLE uses the Idle scheduling class.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>DEADLINE</strong>: SCHED_DEADLINE uses the Deadline scheduling class.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Other classes and policies may be added over time. Scheduling algorithms have been researched that are <em>hyperthreading-aware</em> <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref7">[Bulpin 05]</a> and <em>temperature-aware</em> <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref9">[Otto 06]</a>, which optimize performance by accounting for additional processor factors.</p>
        <p class="noindent">When there is no thread to run, a special <em>idle task</em> (also called <em>idle thread</em>) is executed as a placeholder until another thread is runnable.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_12"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244"></span>Idle Thread</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Introduced in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, the kernel “idle” thread (or <em>idle task</em>) runs on-CPU when there is no other runnable thread and has the lowest possible priority. It is usually programmed to inform the processor that CPU execution may either be halted (halt instruction) or throttled down to conserve power. The CPU will wake up on the next hardware interrupt.</p>

        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_13">NUMA Grouping</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Performance on NUMA systems can be significantly improved by making the kernel <em>NUMA-aware</em>, so that it can make better scheduling and memory placement decisions. This can automatically detect and create groups of localized CPU and memory resources and organize them in a topology to reflect the NUMA architecture. This topology allows the cost of any memory access to be estimated.</p>
        <p class="noindent">On Linux systems, these are called <em>scheduling domains</em>, which are in a topology beginning with the <em>root domain</em>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A manual form of grouping can be performed by the system administrator, either by binding processes to run on one or more CPUs only, or by creating an exclusive set of CPUs for processes to run on. See <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev5sec10">Section 6.5.10</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev5sec10">CPU Binding</a>.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_14">Processor Resource-Aware</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The CPU resource topology can also be understood by the kernel so that it can make better scheduling decisions for power management, hardware cache usage, and load balancing.</p>

You are not expected to use them all; treat this as a cookbook of recipes that may be followed individually or used in combination.</p>
        <p class="noindent">My suggestion is to use the following, in this order: performance monitoring, the USE method, profiling, micro-benchmarking, and static performance tuning.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Section 6.6</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Observability Tools</a>, and later sections, show the operating system tools for applying these methodologies.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec1">6.5.1 Tools Method</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The tools method is a process of iterating over available tools, examining key metrics that they provide. While this is a simple methodology, it can overlook issues for which the tools provide poor or no visibility, and it can be time-consuming to perform.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For CPUs, the tools method can involve checking the following (Linux):</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>uptime/top</code></strong>: Check the load averages to see if load is increasing or decreasing over time. Bear this in mind when using the following tools, as load may be changing during your analysis.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>vmstat</code></strong>: Run vmstat(1) with a one-second interval and check the system-wide CPU utilization (“us” + “sy”). Utilization approaching 100% increases the likelihood of scheduler latency.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>mpstat</code></strong>: Examine statistics per-CPU and check for individual hot (busy) CPUs, identifying a possible thread scalability problem.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>top</code></strong>: See which processes and users are the top CPU consumers.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>pidstat</code></strong>: Break down the top CPU consumers into user- and system-time.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>perf/profile</code></strong>: Profile CPU usage stack traces for both user- or kernel-time, to identify why the CPUs are in use.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>perf</code></strong>: Measure IPC as an indicator of cycle-based inefficiencies.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>showboost/turboboost</code></strong>: Check the current CPU clock rates, in case they are unusually low.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>dmesg</code></strong>: Check for CPU temperature stall messages (“cpu clock throttled”).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">If an issue is found, examine all fields from the available tools to learn more context. See <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Section 6.6</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Observability Tools</a>, for more about each tool.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec2">6.5.2 USE Method</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The USE method can be used to identify bottlenecks and errors across all components early in a performance investigation, before trying deeper and more time-consuming strategies.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For each CPU, check for:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Utilization</strong>: The time the CPU was busy (not in the idle thread)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Saturation</strong>: The degree to which runnable threads are queued waiting their turn on-CPU</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Errors</strong>: CPU errors, including correctable errors</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246"></span>You can check errors first since they are typically quick to check and the easiest to interpret. Some processors and operating systems will sense an increase in correctable errors (error-correction code, ECC) and will offline a CPU as a precaution, before an uncorrectable error causes a CPU failure. Checking for these errors can be a matter of checking that all CPUs are still online.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Utilization is usually readily available from operating system tools as <em>percent busy</em>. This metric should be examined per CPU, to check for scalability issues. High CPU and core utilization can be understood by using profiling and cycle analysis.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For environments that implement CPU limits or quotas (resource controls; e.g., Linux tasksets and cgroups), as is common in cloud computing environments, CPU utilization should be measured in terms of the imposed limit, in addition to the physical limit. Your system may exhaust its CPU quota well before the physical CPUs reach 100% utilization, encountering saturation earlier than expected.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Saturation metrics are commonly provided system-wide, including as part of load averages. This metric quantifies the degree to which the CPUs are overloaded, or a CPU quota, if present, is used up.</p>
        <p class="noindent">You can follow a similar process for checking the health of GPUs and other accelerators, if in use, depending on available metrics.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec3">6.5.3 Workload Characterization</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Characterizing the load applied is important in capacity planning, benchmarking, and simulating workloads. It can also lead to some of the largest performance gains by identifying unnecessary work that can be eliminated.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Basic attributes for characterizing CPU workload are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">CPU load averages (utilization + saturation)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">User-time to system-time ratio</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Syscall rate</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Voluntary context switch rate</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Interrupt rate</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The intent is to characterize the applied load, not the delivered performance. The load averages on some operating systems (e.g., Solaris) show CPU demand only, making them a primary metric for CPU workload characterization. On Linux, however, load averages include other load types. See the example and further explanation in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec1">Section 6.6.1</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec1">uptime</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The rate metrics are a little harder to interpret, as they reflect both the applied load and to some degree the delivered performance, which can throttle their rate.<sup><a id="ch06fn6a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn6">6</a></sup></p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn6" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn6a">6</a></sup>E.g., imagine finding that a given batch computing workload has higher syscall rates when run on faster CPUs, even though the workload is the same. It completes sooner!</p>
        <p class="noindent">The user-time to system-time ratio shows the type of load applied, as introduced earlier in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev3sec9">Section 6.3.9</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev3sec9">User Time/Kernel Time</a>. High user time rates are due to applications spending time <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_247"></span>performing their own compute. High system time shows time spent in the kernel instead, which may be further understood by the syscall and interrupt rate. I/O-bound workloads have higher system time, syscalls, and higher voluntary context switches than CPU-bound workloads as threads block waiting for I/O.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Here is an example workload description, designed to show how these attributes can be expressed together:</p>
        <p class="uln">On an average 48-CPU application server, the load average varies between 30 and 40 during the day. The user/system ratio is 95/5, as this is a CPU-intensive workload. There are around 325 K syscalls/s, and around 80 K voluntary context switches/s.</p>
        <p class="noindent">These characteristics can vary over time as different load is encountered.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_15">Advanced Workload Characterization/Checklist</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Additional details may be included to characterize the workload. These are listed here as questions for consideration, which may also serve as a checklist when studying CPU issues thoroughly:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">What is the CPU utilization system-wide? Per CPU? Per core?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">How parallel is the CPU load? Is it single-threaded? How many threads?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Which applications or users are using the CPUs? How much?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Which kernel threads are using the CPUs? How much?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What is the CPU usage of interrupts?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What is the CPU interconnect utilization?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Why are the CPUs being used (user- and kernel-level call paths)?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What types of stall cycles are encountered?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">See <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Methodologies</a>, for a higher-level summary of this methodology and the characteristics to measure (who, why, what, how). The sections that follow expand upon the last two questions in this list: how call paths can be analyzed using profiling, and stall cycles using cycle analysis.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec4">6.5.4 Profiling</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Profiling builds a picture of the target for study. CPU profiling can be performed in different ways, typically either:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Timer-based sampling</strong>: Collecting timer-based samples of the currently running function or stack trace. A typical rate used is 99 Hertz (samples per second) per CPU. This provides a coarse view of CPU usage, with enough detail for large and small issues. 99 is used to avoid lock-step sampling that may occur at 100 Hertz, which would produce a skewed profile. If needed, the timer rate can be lowered and the time span enlarged until the overhead is negligible and suitable for production use.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248"></span><strong>Function tracing</strong>: Instrumenting all or some function calls to measure their duration. This provides a fine-level view, but the overhead can be prohibitive for production use, often 10% or more, because function tracing adds instrumentation to every function call.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Most profilers used in production, and those in this book, use timer-based sampling. This is pictured in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig14">Figure 6.14</a>, where an application calls function A(), which calls function B(), and so on, while stack trace samples are collected. See <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Operating Systems</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03lev2sec7">Section 3.2.7</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03lev2sec7">Stacks</a>, for an explanation of stack traces and how to read them.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig14">Figure 6.14</a> shows how samples are only collected when the process is on-CPU: two samples show function A() on-CPU, and two samples show function B() on-CPU called by A(). The time off-CPU during a syscall was not sampled. Also, the short-lived function C() was entirely missed by sampling.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Kernels typically maintain two stack traces for processes: a user-level stack and a kernel stack when in kernel context (e.g., syscalls). For a complete CPU profile, the profiler must record both stacks when available.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Apart from sampling stack traces, profilers can also record just the instruction pointer, which shows the on-CPU function and instruction offset. Sometimes this is sufficient for solving issues, without the extra overhead of collecting stack traces.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_16">Sample Processing</h5>
        <p class="noindent">As described in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, a typical CPU profile at Netflix collects user and kernel stack traces at 49 Hertz across (around) 32 CPUs for 30 seconds: this produces a total of 47,040 samples, and presents two challenges:</p>

        <li><p class="number"><strong>Storage I/O</strong>: Profilers typically write samples to a profile file, which can then be read and examined in different ways. However, writing so many samples to the file system can generate storage I/O that perturbs the performance of the production application. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249"></span>BPF-based profile(8) tool solves the storage I/O problem by summarizing the samples in kernel memory, and only emitting the summary. No intermediate profile file is used.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number"><strong>Comprehension</strong>: It is impractical to read 47,040 multi-line stack traces one by one: summaries and visualizations must be used to make sense of the profile. A commonly used stack trace visualization is <em>flame graphs</em>, some examples of which are shown in earlier chapters (<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">1</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">5</a>); and there are more examples in this chapter.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig15">Figure 6.15</a> shows the overall steps to generate CPU flame graphs from perf(1) and profile, solving the comprehension problem. It also shows how the storage I/O problem is solved: profile(8) does not use an intermediate file, saving overhead.

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_17">Profile Interpretation</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Once you have collected and summarized or visualized a CPU profile, your next task is to understand it and search for performance problems. A CPU flame graph excerpt is shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig16">Figure 6.16</a>, and the instructions for reading this visualization are in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev7sec3">Section 6.7.3</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev7sec3">Flame Graphs</a>. How would you summarize the profile?</p>

        <p class="noindent">My method for finding performance wins in a CPU flame graphs is as follows:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="number">Look top-down (leaf to root) for large “plateaus.” These show that a single function is on-CPU during many samples, and can lead to some quick wins. In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig16">Figure 6.16</a>, there are two plateaus on the right, in unmap_page_range() and page_remove_rmap(), both related to memory pages. Perhaps a quick win is to switch the application to use large pages.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Look bottom-up to understand the code hierarchy. In this example, the bash(1) shell was calling the execve(2) syscall, which eventually called the page functions. Perhaps an even bigger win is to avoid execve(2) somehow, such as by using bash builtins instead of external processes, or switching to another language.</p></li>
        <li><p class="number">Look more carefully top-down for scattered but common CPU usage. Perhaps there are many small frames related to the same problem, such as lock contention. Inverting the merge order of flame graphs so that they are merged from leaf to root and become <em>icicle graphs</em> can help reveal these cases.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_18">Further Information</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The commands for CPU profiling and flame graphs are provided in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Section 6.6</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Observability Tools</a>. Also see <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev4sec1">Section 5.4.1</a> on CPU analysis of applications, and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev6">Section 5.6</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev6">Gotchas</a>, which describes common profiling problems with missing stack traces and symbols.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For the usage of specific CPU resources, such as caches and interconnects, profiling can use PMC-based event triggers instead of timed intervals. This is described in the next section.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_251"></span>6.5.5 Cycle Analysis</h4>
        <p class="noindent">You can use Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) to understand CPU utilization at the cycle level. This may reveal that cycles are spent stalled on Level 1, 2, or 3 cache misses, memory or resource I/O, or spent on floating-point operations or other activity. This information may show performance wins you can achieve by adjusting compiler options or changing the code.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Begin cycle analysis by measuring IPC (inverse of CPI). If IPC is low, continue to investigate types of stall cycles. If IPC is high, look for ways in the code to reduce instructions performed. The values for “high” or “low” IPC depend on your processor: low could be less than 0.2, and high could be greater than 1. You can get a sense of these values by performing known workloads that are either memory I/O-intensive or instruction-intensive, and measuring the resulting IPC for each.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Apart from measuring counter values, PMCs can be configured to interrupt the kernel on the overflow of a given value. For example, at every 10,000 Level 3 cache misses, the kernel could be interrupted to gather a stack backtrace. Over time, the kernel builds a profile of the code paths that are causing Level 3 cache misses, without the prohibitive overhead of measuring every single miss. This is typically used by integrated developer environment (IDE) software, to annotate code with the locations that are causing memory I/O and stall cycles.</p>
        <p class="noindent">As described in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Observability Tools</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev3sec9">Section 4.3.9</a> under PMC Challenges, overflow sampling can miss recording the correct instruction due to skid and out-of-order execution. On Intel the solution is PEBS, which is supported by the Linux perf(1) tool.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Cycle analysis is an advanced activity that can take days to perform with command-line tools, as demonstrated in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Section 6.6</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Observability Tools</a>. You should also expect to spend some quality time with your CPU vendor’s processor manuals. Performance analyzers such as Intel vTune <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref36">[Intel 20b]</a> and AMD uprof <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref30">[AMD 20]</a> can save time as they are programmed to find the PMCs of interest to you.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec6">6.5.6 Performance Monitoring</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Performance monitoring can identify active issues and patterns of behavior over time. Key metrics for CPUs are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Utilization</strong>: Percent busy</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Saturation</strong>: Either run-queue length or scheduler latency</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Utilization should be monitored on a per-CPU basis to identify thread scalability issues. For environments that implement CPU limits or quotas (resource controls), such as cloud computing environments, CPU usage compared to these limits should also be recorded.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Choosing the right interval to measure and archive is a challenge in monitoring CPU usage. Some monitoring tools use five-minute intervals, which can hide the existence of shorter bursts of CPU utilization. Per-second measurements are preferable, but you should be aware that there can be bursts even within one second. These can be identified from saturation, and examined using FlameScope (<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev7sec4">Section 6.7.4</a>), which was created for subsecond analysis.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Static performance tuning focuses on issues of the configured environment. For CPU performance, examine the following aspects of the static configuration:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">How many CPUs are available for use? Are they cores? Hardware threads?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Are GPUs or other accelerators available and in use?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Is the CPU architecture single- or multiprocessor?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What is the size of the CPU caches? Are they shared?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What is the CPU clock speed? Is it dynamic (e.g., Intel Turbo Boost and SpeedStep)? Are those dynamic features enabled in the BIOS?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What other CPU-related features are enabled or disabled in the BIOS? E.g., turboboost, bus settings, power saving settings?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Are there performance issues (bugs) with this processor model? Are they listed in the processor errata sheet?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What is the microcode version? Does it include performance-impacting mitigations for security vulnerabilities (e.g., Spectre/Meltdown)?</p></li>

        <li><p class="bull">Are there software-imposed CPU usage limits (resource controls) present? What are they?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The answers to these questions may reveal previously overlooked configuration choices.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec8">6.5.8 Priority Tuning</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Unix has always provided a nice(2) system call for adjusting process priority, which sets a nice-ness value. Positive nice values result in lower process priority (nicer), and negative values—which can be set only by the superuser (root)<sup><a id="ch06fn7a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn7">7</a></sup>—result in higher priority. A nice(1) command became available to launch programs with nice values, and a renice(1M) command was later added (in BSD) to adjust the nice value of already running processes. The man page from Unix 4th edition provides this example <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref5">[TUHS 73]</a>:</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn7" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn7a">7</a></sup>Since Linux 2.6.12, a “nice ceiling” can be modified per process, allowing non-root processes to have lower nice values. E.g., using: prlimit <code>--nice=-19 -p PID.</code></p>
        <p class="uln">The value of 16 is recommended to users who wish to execute long-running programs without flak from the administration.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The nice value is still useful today for adjusting process priority. This is most effective when there is contention for CPUs, causing scheduler latency for high-priority work. Your task is to identify low-priority work, which may include monitoring agents and scheduled backups, that can be modified to start with a nice value. Analysis may also be performed to check that the tuning is effective, and that the scheduler latency remains low for high-priority work.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_253"></span>Beyond nice, the operating system may provide more advanced controls for process priority such as changing the scheduler class and scheduler policy, and tunable parameters. Linux includes a <em>real-time scheduling class</em>, which can allow processes to preempt all other work. While this can eliminate scheduler latency (other than for other real-time processes and interrupts), make sure that you understand the consequences. If the real-time application encounters a bug where multiple threads enter an infinite loop, it can cause all CPUs to become unavailable for all other work—including the administrative shell required to manually fix the problem.<sup><a id="ch06fn8a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn8">8</a></sup></p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn8" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn8a">8</a></sup>Linux has a solution since 2.6.25 for this problem: RLIMIT_RTTIME, which sets a limit in microseconds of CPU time a real-time thread may consume before making a blocking syscall.</p>

These may include fixed limits for CPU utilization and shares for a more flexible approach—allowing idle CPU cycles to be consumed based on a share value.

        <p class="noindent">Another way to tune CPU performance involves binding processes and threads to individual CPUs, or collections of CPUs. This can increase CPU cache warmth for the process, improving its memory I/O performance. For NUMA systems it also improves memory locality, further improving performance.</p>
        <p class="noindent">There are generally two ways this is performed:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>CPU binding</strong>: Configuring a process to run only on a single CPU, or only on one CPU from a defined set.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Exclusive CPU sets</strong>: Partitioning a set of CPUs that can be used only by the process(es) assigned to them. This can further improve CPU cache warmth, as when the process is idle other processes cannot use those CPUs.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">On Linux-based systems, the exclusive CPU sets approach can be implemented using <em>cpusets</em>. Configuration examples are provided in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev9">Section 6.9</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev9">Tuning</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev5sec11">6.5.11 Micro-Benchmarking</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Tools for CPU micro-benchmarking typically measure the time taken to perform a simple operation many times. The operation may be based on:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>CPU instructions</strong>: Integer arithmetic, floating-point operations, memory loads and stores, branch and other instructions</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Memory access</strong>: To investigate latency of different CPU caches and main memory throughput</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Higher-level languages</strong>: Similar to CPU instruction testing, but written in a higher-level interpreted or compiled language</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_254"></span><strong>Operating system operations</strong>: Testing system library and system call functions that are CPU-bound, such as getpid(2) and process creation</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">An early example of a CPU benchmark is Whetstone by the National Physical Laboratory, written in 1972 in Algol 60 and intended to simulate a scientific workload. The Dhrystone benchmark was developed in 1984 to simulate integer workloads of the time, and became a popular means to compare CPU performance. These, and various Unix benchmarks including process creation and pipe throughput, were included in a collection called <em>UnixBench</em>, originally from Monash University and published by <em><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_025">BYTE</a></em> magazine <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref6">[Hinnant 84]</a>. More recent CPU benchmarks have been created to test compression speeds, prime number calculation, encryption, and encoding.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Whichever benchmark you use, when comparing results between systems, it’s important that you understand what is really being tested. Benchmarks like those listed earlier often end up testing differences in compiler optimizations between compiler versions, rather than the benchmark code or CPU speed. Many benchmarks execute single-threaded, and their results lose meaning in systems with multiple CPUs. (A four-CPU system may benchmark slightly faster than an eight-CPU system, but the latter is likely to deliver much greater throughput when given enough parallel runnable threads.)</p>

We begin with traditional tools for CPU statistics, then proceed to tools for deeper analysis using code-path profiling, CPU cycle analysis, and tracing tools. Some of the traditional tools are likely available on (and sometimes originated on) other Unix-like operating systems, including: uptime(1), vmstat(8), mpstat(1), sar(1), ps(1), top(1), and time(1). The tracing tools are based on BPF and the BCC and bpftrace frontends (<a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>), and are: profile(8), cpudist(8), runqlat(8), runqlen(8), softirqs(8), and hardirqs(8).</p>

        <p class="noindent">The last three numbers are the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute load averages. By comparing the three numbers, you can determine if the load is increasing, decreasing, or steady during the last 15 minutes (or so). This can be useful to know: if you are responding to a production performance issue and find that the load is decreasing, you may have missed the issue; if the load is increasing, the issue may be getting worse!</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following sections explain load averages in more detail, but they are only a starting point, so you shouldn’t spend more than five minutes considering them before moving on to other metrics.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_19">Load Averages</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The load averages indicate the demand for system resources: higher means more demand. On some operating systems (e.g., Solaris) the load averages show CPU demand, as did early versions of Linux. But in 1993, Linux changed load averages to show system-wide demand: CPUs, disks, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_256"></span>other resources.<sup><a id="ch06fn9a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn9">9</a></sup> This was implemented by including threads in the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE thread state, shown by some tools as state “D” (this state was mentioned in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Applications</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev4sec5">Section 5.4.5</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev4sec5">Thread State Analysis</a>).</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch06fn9" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn9a">9</a></sup>The change happened so long ago that the reason for it had been forgotten and was undocumented, predating the Linux history in git and other resources; I eventually found the original patch in an online tarball from an old mail system archive. Matthias Urlichs made that change, pointing out that if demand moved from CPUs to disks, then the load averages should stay the same because the demand hadn’t changed <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref21">[Gregg 17c]</a>. I emailed him (for the first time ever) about his 24-year old change, and got a reply in one hour!</p>
        <p class="noindent">The <em>load</em> is measured as the current resource usage (utilization) plus queued requests (saturation). Imagine a car toll plaza: you could measure the load at various points during the day by counting how many cars were being serviced (utilization) plus how many cars were queued (saturation).</p>
        <p class="noindent">The <em>average</em> is an exponentially damped moving average, which reflects load beyond the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute times (the times are actually constants used in the exponential moving sum <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref3">[Myer 73]</a>). <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig17">Figure 6.17</a> shows the results of a simple experiment where a single CPU-bound thread was launched and the load averages plotted.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">By the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute marks, the load averages had reached about 61% of the known load of 1.0.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Load averages were introduced to Unix in early BSD and were based on scheduler average queue length and load averages commonly used by earlier operating systems (CTSS, Multics <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref1">[Saltzer 70]</a>, TENEX <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref2">[Bobrow 72]</a>). They were described in RFC 546 <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref4">[Thomas 73]</a>:</p>
        <p class="uln">[1] The TENEX load average is a measure of CPU demand. The load average is an average of the number of runable processes over a given time period. For example, an hourly load average of 10 would mean that (for a single CPU system) at any time during that hour one could expect to see 1 process running and 9 others ready to run (i.e., not blocked for I/O) waiting for the CPU.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_257"></span>As a modern example, consider a 64-CPU system with a load average of 128. If the load was CPU only, it would mean that on average there is always one thread running on each CPU, and one thread waiting for each CPU. The same system with a CPU load average of 20 would indicate significant headroom, as it could run another 44 CPU-bound threads before all CPUs are busy. (Some companies monitor a normalized load average metric, where it is automatically divided by the CPU count, allowing it to be interpreted without knowing the CPU count.)</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_20">Pressure Stall Information (PSI)</h5>
        <p class="noindent">In the first edition of this book, I described how load averages could be provided for each resource type to aid interpretation. An interface has now been added in Linux 4.20 that provides such a breakdown: pressure stall information (PSI), which gives averages for CPU, memory, and I/O. The average shows the percent of time something was stalled on a resource (saturation only). This is compared with load averages in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06tab09">Table 6.9</a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The first line of output is supposed to be the summary-since-boot. However, on Linux the <code>procs</code> and <code>memory</code> columns begin by showing the current state. (Perhaps one day they will be fixed.) CPU-related columns are:</p>

        <p class="noindent">A system-wide summary is at the top and a process/task listing at the bottom, sorted by the top CPU consumer by default. The system-wide summary includes the load averages and CPU states: <code>%us</code>, <code>%sy</code>, <code>%ni</code>, <code>%id</code>, <code>%wa</code>, <code>%hi</code>, <code>%si</code>, <code>%st</code>. These states are equivalent to those printed by mpstat(1), as described earlier, and are averaged across all CPUs.</p>
        <p class="noindent">CPU usage is shown by the <code>TIME</code> and <code>%CPU</code> columns. <code>TIME</code> is the total CPU time consumed by the process at a resolution of hundredths of a second. For example, “1:36.53” means 1 minute and 36.53 seconds of on-CPU time in total. Some versions of top(1) provide an optional “cumulative time” mode, which includes the CPU time from child processes that have exited.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_262"></span>The <code>%CPU</code> column shows the total CPU utilization for the current screen update interval. On Linux, this is not normalized by the CPU count, and so a two-thread CPU-bound process will report 200%; top(1) calls this “Irix mode,” after its behavior on IRIX. This can be switched to “Solaris mode” (by pressing <code>I</code> to toggle the modes), which divides the CPU usage by the CPU count. In that case, the two-thread process on a 16-CPU server would report CPU as 12.5%.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Though top(1) is often a tool for beginning performance analysts, you should be aware that the CPU usage of top(1) itself can become significant and place top(1) as the top CPU-consuming process! This has been due to the system calls it uses to read /proc—open(2), read(2), close(2)—and calling these over many processes. Some versions of top(1) on other operating systems have reduced the overhead by leaving file descriptors open and calling pread(2).</p>
        <p class="noindent">There is a variant of top(1) called htop(1), which provides more interactive features, customizations, and ASCII bar charts for CPU usage. It also calls four times as many syscalls, perturbing the system even further. I rarely use it.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Since top(1) takes snapshots of /proc, it can miss short-lived processes that exit before a snapshot is taken. This commonly happens during software builds, where the CPUs can be heavily loaded by many short-lived tools from the build process. A variant of top(1) for Linux, called atop(1), uses process accounting to catch the presence of short-lived processes, which it includes in its display.</p>

This is performed by the <code>record</code> command, which captures sample to a perf.data file. A <code>report</code> command can then be used to view the contents of the file. It works by using the most accurate timer available: CPU-cycle-based if available, otherwise software based (the cpu-clock event).</p>

        <p class="noindent">This latency report summarizes average and maximum scheduler latency (aka run queue latency) per process. While there were many context switches for the oltp_read_only and mysqld processes, their average and maximum scheduler latencies were still low. (To fit the output width here, I elided a final “Maximum delay at” column.)</p>
        <p class="noindent">Scheduler events are frequent, so this type of tracing incurs significant CPU and storage overhead. The perf.data file in this case was 125 Mbytes from only ten seconds of tracing. The rate of scheduler events may inundate perf(1)’s per-CPU ring buffers, causing events to be lost: the report will state this at the end if it happened. Be careful with this overhead, as it may perturb production applications.</p>
        <p class="noindent">perf(1) <code>sched</code> also has <code>map</code> and <code>timehist</code> reports for displaying the scheduler profile in different ways. The timehist report shows per-event details:</p>

(See the hardirqs(8) tool in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec19">Section 6.6.19</a> for more CPU consumers.) profile(8) has lower overhead than perf(1) as only the stack trace summary is passed to user space.

        <p class="noindent">On this kernel version (5.3) there are 24 sched tracepoints and 104 possible kprobes beginning with “sched.”</p>
        <p class="noindent">Because scheduler events can be frequent, instrumenting them can consume significant overhead. Use caution and find ways to reduce this overhead: use maps to summarize statistics instead of printing per-event details, and trace the fewest possible events.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_34">GPUs</h5>
        <p class="noindent">There is not yet a comprehensive set of standard tools for GPU analysis. GPU vendors typically release specific tools that only work for their own products. Examples include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>nvidia-smi</strong>, <strong>nvperf</strong>, and <strong>Nvidia Visual Profiler</strong>: For Nvidia GPUs</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>intel_gpu_top</strong> and <strong>Intel vTune</strong>: For Intel GPUs</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>radeontop</strong>: For Radeon GPUs</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">These tools provide basic observability statistics such as instruction rates and GPU resource utilization. Other possible observability sources are PMCs and tracepoints (try <code>perf list | grep gpu</code>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">GPU profiling is different from CPU profiling, as GPUs do not have a stack trace showing code path ancestry. Profilers instead can instrument API and memory transfer calls and their timing.</p>

        <p class="noindent">CPU usage has historically been visualized as line graphs of utilization or load average, including the original X11 load tool (xload(1)). Such line graphs are an effective way to show variation, as magnitudes can be visually compared. They can also show patterns over time, as was shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Methodologies</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02lev9">Section 2.9</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02lev9">Monitoring</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">However, line graphs of per-CPU utilization don’t scale with the CPU counts we see today, especially for cloud computing environments involving tens of thousands of CPUs—a graph of 10,000 lines can become paint.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Other statistics plotted as line graphs, including averages, standard deviations, maximums, and percentiles, provide some value and do scale. However, CPU utilization is often <em>bimodal</em>—composed of some CPUs that are idle or near-idle, and some at 100% utilization—which is not effectively conveyed with these statistics. The full distribution often needs to be studied. A utilization heat map makes this possible.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following sections introduce CPU utilization heat maps, CPU subsecond-offset heat maps, flame graphs, and FlameScope. I created these visualization types to solve problems in enterprise and cloud performance analysis.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev7sec1">6.7.1 Utilization Heat Map</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Utilization versus time can be presented as a heat map, with the saturation (darkness) of each pixel showing the number of CPUs at that utilization and time range <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref13">[Gregg 10a]</a>. Heat maps were introduced in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Methodologies</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig19">Figure 6.19</a> shows CPU utilization for an entire data center, running a public cloud environment. It includes over 300 physical servers and 5,312 CPUs.</p>
        <figure class="image-c" id="ch06fig19">

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_289"></span>The darker shading at the bottom of this heat map shows that most CPUs are running between 0% and 30% utilization. However, the solid line at the top shows that, over time, there are also some CPUs at 100% utilization. The fact that the line is dark shows that multiple CPUs were at 100%, not just one.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev7sec2">6.7.2 Subsecond-Offset Heat Map</h4>
        <p class="noindent">This heat map type allows activity within a second to be examined. CPU activity is typically measured in microseconds or milliseconds; reporting this data as averages over an entire second can wipe out useful information. The subsecond-offset heat map puts the subsecond offset on the y-axis, with the number of non-idle CPUs at each offset shown by the saturation. This visualizes each second as a column, “painting” it from bottom to top.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig20">Figure 6.20</a> shows a CPU subsecond-offset heat map for a cloud database (Riak).</p>
        <figure class="image-c" id="ch06fig20">

        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">What is interesting about this heat map isn’t the times that the CPUs were busy servicing the database, but the times that they were not, indicated by the white columns. The duration of these gaps was also interesting: hundreds of milliseconds during which none of the database threads were on-CPU. This led to the discovery of a locking issue where the entire database was blocked for hundreds of milliseconds at a time.</p>
        <p class="noindent">If we had examined this data using a line graph, a dip in per-second CPU utilization might have been dismissed as variable load and not investigated further.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev7sec3">6.7.3 Flame Graphs</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Profiling stack traces is an effective way to explain CPU usage, showing which kernel- or user-level code paths are responsible. It can, however, produce thousands of pages of output. CPU flame graphs visualize the profile stack frames, so that CPU usage can be understood more quickly and more clearly <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref18">[Gregg 16b]</a>. The example in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig21">Figure 6.21</a> shows the Linux kernel profiled using perf(1) as a CPU flame graph.</p>
        <figure class="image-c" id="ch06fig21">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780136821694/files/graphics/06fig21.jpg" alt="Images" width="776" height="578">

        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">Flame graphs can be built from any CPU profile that include stack traces, including profiles from perf(1), profile(8), bpftrace, and many more. Flame graphs can also visualize profiles other than CPU profiles. This section describes CPU flame graphs generated by flamegraph.pl <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref34">[Gregg 20g]</a>. (There are many other implementations, including d3 flame graphs created by my colleague Martin Spier <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref39">[Spier 20a]</a>.)</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_35">Characteristics</h5>
        <p class="noindent">A CPU flame graph has the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">Each box represents a function in the stack (a “stack frame”).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The <strong>y-axis</strong> shows stack depth (number of frames on the stack). The top-most box shows the function that was on-CPU. Everything beneath that is ancestry. The function beneath a function is its parent, just as in the stack traces shown earlier.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The <strong>x-axis</strong> spans the sample population. It does not show the passing of time from left to right, as most graphs do. The left-to-right ordering has no meaning (it’s sorted alphabetically).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The <strong>width</strong> of the box shows the total time the function was on-CPU or part of an ancestry that was on-CPU (based on sample count). Wider box functions may be slower than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_291"></span>narrow box functions, or they may simply be called more often. The call count is not shown (nor is it known via sampling).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The sample count can exceed elapsed time if multiple threads were running and sampled in parallel.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_36">Colors</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The frames can be colored based on different schemes. The default shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig21">Figure 6.21</a> uses random warm colors for each frame, which helps visually distinguish adjacent towers. Over the years I’ve added more color schemes. I’ve found the following to be most useful to flame graph end users:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Hue</strong>: The hue indicates the code type.<sup><a id="ch06fn17a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn17">17</a></sup> For example, red can indicate native user-level code, orange for native kernel-level code, yellow for C++, green for interpreted functions, aqua for inlined functions, and so on depending on the languages you use. Magenta is used to highlight search matches. Some developers have customized flame graphs to always highlight their own code in a certain hue so that it stands out.</p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch06fn17" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn17a">17</a></sup>This was suggested to me by my colleague Amer Ather. My first version was a five-minute regex hack.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Saturation</strong>: Saturation is hashed from the function name. It provides some color variance that helps differentiate adjacent towers, while preserving the same colors for function names to more easily compare multiple flame graphs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Background color</strong>: The background color provides a visual reminder of the flame graph type. For example, you might use yellow for CPU flame graphs, blue for off-CPU or I/O flame graphs, and green for memory flame graphs.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Another useful color scheme is one used for IPC (instructions per cycle) flame graphs, where an additional dimension, IPC, is visualized by coloring each frame using a gradient from blue to white to red.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_37">Interactivity</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Flame graphs are <em>interactive</em>. My original flamegraph.pl generates an SVG with an embedded JavaScript routine, that when opened in a browser allows you to mouse over elements to reveal details at the bottom, and other interactive functions. In the <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig21">Figure 6.21</a> example, start_xmit() was highlighted, which shows that it was present in 72.55% of the sampled stacks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">You can also click to zoom<sup><a id="ch06fn18a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn18">18</a></sup> and Ctrl-F to search<sup><a id="ch06fn19a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn19">19</a></sup> for a term. When searching, a cumulative percentage is also shown to indicate how often a stack trace containing that search term was present. This makes it trivial to calculate how much of the profile was in particular code areas. For example, you can search for “tcp_” to show how much was in the kernel TCP code.</p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch06fn18" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn18a">18</a></sup>Adrien Mahieux developed the horizontal zoom feature for flame graphs.</p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch06fn19" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn19a">19</a></sup>Thorsten Lorenz first added a search feature to his flame graph implementation.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3_38">Interpretation</h5>
        <p class="noindent">To explain how to interpret a flame graph in detail, consider the simple synthetic CPU flame graph shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig22">Figure 6.22</a>.</p>
        <figure class="image-c" id="ch06fig22">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780136821694/files/graphics/06fig22.jpg" alt="Images" width="775" height="223">

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">The top edge has been highlighted with a line: this shows the functions that are directly running on-CPU. func_c() was directly on-CPU for 70% of the time, func_b() was on-CPU for 20% of the time, and func_e() was on-CPU for 10% of the time. The other functions, func_a() and func_d(), were never sampled on-CPU directly.</p>
        <p class="noindent">To read a flame graph, look for the widest towers and understand them first. In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig22">Figure 6.22</a>, it is the code path func_a() -&gt; func_b() -&gt; func_c(). In the <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig21">Figure 6.21</a> flame graph, it is the code path that ends in the iowrite16() plateau.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For large profiles of thousands of samples, there may be code paths that were sampled only a few times, and are printed in such a narrow tower that there is no room to include the function name. This turns out to be a benefit: Your attention is naturally drawn to the wider towers that have legible function names, and looking at them helps you understand the bulk of the profile first.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Note that for recursive functions, each level is shown by a separate frame.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev7sec4">6.7.4 FlameScope</h4>
        <p class="noindent">FlameScope is an open-source tool developed at Netflix that marries the previous two visualizations: subsecond-offset heat maps and flame graphs <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref23">[Gregg 18b]</a>. A subsecond-offset heat map shows a CPU profile, and ranges including subsecond ranges can be selected to show a flame graph just for that range. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig23">Figure 6.23</a> shows the FlameScope heat map with annotations and instructions.</p>
        <p class="noindent">FlameScope is suited for studying issues or perturbations and variance. These can be too small to see in a CPU profile, which shows the full profile at once: a 100 ms CPU perturbation during a 30-second profile will only span 0.3% of the width of a flame graph. In FlameScope, a 100 ms perturbation will show up as a vertical stripe 1/10th of the height of the heat map. Several such perturbations are visible in the <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fig23">Figure 6.23</a> example. When selected, a CPU flame graph is shown just for those time ranges, showing the code paths responsible.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev9">6.9 Tuning</h3>
        <p class="noindent">For CPUs, the biggest performance wins are typically those that eliminate unnecessary work, which is an effective form of tuning. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev5">Section 6.5</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev5">Methodology</a>, and <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Section 6.6</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6">Observability Tools</a>, introduced many ways to analyze and identify the work performed, helping you find any <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_295"></span>unnecessary work. Other methodologies for tuning were also introduced: priority tuning and CPU binding. This section includes these and other tuning examples.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The specifics of tuning—the options available and what to set them to—depend on the processor type, the operating system version, and the intended workload. The following, organized by type, provide examples of what options may be available and how they are tuned. The earlier methodology sections provide guidance on when and why these tunables would be tuned.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec1">6.9.1 Compiler Options</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Compilers, and the options they provide for code optimization, can have a dramatic effect on CPU performance. Common options include compiling for 64-bit instead of 32-bit, and selecting a level of optimizations. Compiler optimization is discussed in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Applications</a>.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec2">6.9.2 Scheduling Priority and Class</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The nice(1) command can be used to adjust process priority. Positive nice values decrease priority, and negative nice values (which only the superuser can set) <em>increase</em> priority. The range is from -20 to +19. For example:</p>
        <pre class="pretb">$ <strong>nice -n 19 <em>command</em></strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">runs the command with a nice value of 19—the lowest priority that nice can set. To change the priority of an already running process, use renice(1).</p>
        <p class="noindent">On Linux, the chrt(1) command can show and set the scheduling priority directly, and the scheduling policy. For example:</p>
        <pre class="pretb">$ <strong>chrt -b <em>command</em></strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">will run the command in SCHED_BATCH (see Scheduling Classes in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4sec2">Section 6.4.2</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev4sec2">Software</a>). Both nice(1) and chrt(1) can also be directed at a PID instead of launching a command (see their man pages).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Scheduling priority can also be set directly using the setpriority(2) syscall, and the priority and scheduling policy can be set using the sched_setscheduler(2) syscall.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Linux supports different CPU scaling governors that control the CPU clock frequencies via software (the kernel). These can be set via /sys files. For example, for CPU 0:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch06_images.xhtml#pg297-1a" id="pg297-1">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pretb"># <strong>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_available_governors</strong>
        performance powersave
        # <strong>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor</strong>
        powersave</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This is an example of an untuned system: the current governor is “powersave,” which will use lower CPU frequencies to save power. This can be set to “performance” to always use the maximum frequency. For example:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch06_images.xhtml#pg297-2a" id="pg297-2">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pretb"># <strong>echo performance &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">This must be done for all CPUs (policy0..N). This policy directory also contains files for setting the frequency directly (scaling_setspeed) and determining the range of possible frequencies (scaling_min_freq, scaling_max_freq).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Setting the CPUs to always run at maximum frequency may come with an enormous cost to the environment. If this setting does not provide a significant performance improvement, consider continuing to use the <code>powersave</code> setting for the sake of the planet. For hosts with the access to power MSRs (cloud guests may filter them), you can also use these MSRs to instrument the power consumed with and without a max CPU frequency setting, to quantify (part of<sup><a id="ch06fn20a" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn20">20</a></sup>) the environmental cost.</p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch06fn20" href="ch06.xhtml#ch06fn20a">20</a></sup>Host-based power measurements do not account for the environmental costs of server air conditioning, server manufacturing and transportation, and other costs.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec5">6.9.5 Power States</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Processor power states can be enabled and disabled using the cpupower(1) tool. As seen earlier in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec21">Section 6.6.21</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev6sec21">Other Tools</a>, deeper sleep states can have high exit latency (890 μs for C10 was shown). Individual states can be disabled using <code>-d</code>, and <code>-D</code> <em>latency</em> will disable all states with higher exit latency than that given (in microseconds). This allows you to fine-tune which lower-power states may be used, disabling those with excessive latency.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec6">6.9.6 CPU Binding</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A process may be bound to one or more CPUs, which may increase its performance by improving cache warmth and memory locality.</p>
        <p class="noindent">On Linux, this can be performed using the taskset(1) command, which uses a CPU mask or ranges to set CPU affinity. For example:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch06_images.xhtml#pg297-3a" id="pg297-3">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pretb">$ <strong>taskset -pc 7-10 10790</strong>
        pid 10790's current affinity list: 0-15
        pid 10790's new affinity list: 7-10</pre>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_298"></span>This sets PID 10790 to run only on CPUs 7 through 10.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The numactl(8) command can also set CPU binding as well as memory node binding (see <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Memory</a>, <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07lev6sec4">Section 7.6.4</a>, <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07lev6sec4">NUMA Binding</a>).</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec7">6.9.7 Exclusive CPU Sets</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Linux provides <em>cpusets</em>, which allow CPUs to be grouped and processes assigned to them. This can improve performance similarly to CPU binding, but performance can be further improved by making the cpuset exclusive, preventing other processes from using it. The trade-off is a reduction in available CPU for the rest of the system.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following commented example creates an exclusive set:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch06_images.xhtml#pg298a" id="pg298">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pretb"># <strong>mount -t cgroup -ocpuset cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset</strong>  # may not be necessary
        # <strong>cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset</strong>
        # <strong>mkdir prodset</strong>                    # create a cpuset called "prodset"
        # <strong>cd prodset</strong>
        # <strong>echo 7-10 &gt; cpuset.cpus</strong>          # assign CPUs 7-10
        # <strong>echo 1 &gt; cpuset.cpu_exclusive</strong>    # make prodset exclusive
        # <strong>echo 1159 &gt; tasks</strong>         # assign PID 1159 to prodset</pre>
        <p class="noindent">For reference, see the cpuset(7) man page.</p>
        <p class="noindent">When creating CPU sets, you may also wish to study which CPUs will continue to service interrupts. The irqbalance(1) daemon will attempt to distribute interrupts across CPUs to improve performance. You can manually set CPU affinity by IRQ via the /proc/irq/<em><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_086">IRQ</a></em>/smp_affinity files.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec8">6.9.8 Resource Controls</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Apart from associating processes with whole CPUs, modern operating systems provide resource controls for fine-grained allocation of CPU usage.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For Linux, there are control groups (cgroups), which can also control resource usage by processes or groups of processes. CPU usage can be controlled using shares, and the CFS scheduler allows fixed limits to be imposed (<em>CPU bandwidth</em>), in terms of allocating microseconds of CPU cycles per interval.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Cloud Computing</a>, describes a use case of managing the CPU usage of OS virtualized tenants, including how shares and limits can be used in concert.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Various kernel mitigations for the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities have the side effect of reducing performance. There may be some scenario where security is not a requirement but high performance is, and you wish to disable these mitigations. Because this is not recommended (due to the security risk), I will not include all the options here; but you should know that they exist. They are grub command line options that include nospectre_v1 and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_299"></span>nospectre_v2. These are documented in Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt in the Linux source <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06ref38">[Linux 20f]</a>; an excerpt:</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev9sec10">6.9.10 Processor Options (BIOS Tuning)</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Processors typically provide settings to enable, disable, and tune processor-level features. On x86 systems, these are typically accessed via the BIOS settings menu at boot time.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The settings usually provide maximum performance by default and don’t need to be adjusted. The most common reason I adjust these today is to disable Intel Turbo Boost, so that CPU benchmarks execute with a consistent clock rate (bearing in mind that, for production use, Turbo Boost should be enabled for slightly faster performance).</p>
