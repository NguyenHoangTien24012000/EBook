        <p class="chap_ttl">Observability Tools</p>
        <p class="noindent">Operating systems have historically provided many tools for observing system software and hardware components. To the newcomer, the wide range of available tools and metrics suggested that everything—or at least everything important—could be observed. In reality there were many gaps, and systems performance experts became skilled in the art of inference and interpretation: figuring out activity from indirect tools and statistics. For example, network packets could be examined individually (sniffing), but disk I/O could not (at least, not easily).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Observability has greatly improved in Linux thanks to the rise of dynamic tracing tools, including the BPF-based BCC and bpftrace. Dark corners are now illuminated, including individual disk I/O using biosnoop(8). However, many companies and commercial monitoring products have not yet adopted system tracing, and are missing out on the insight it brings. I have led the way by developing, publishing, and explaining new tracing tools, tools already in use by companies such as Netflix and Facebook.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The learning objectives of this chapter are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">Identify static performance tools and crisis tools.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Understand tool types and their overhead: counters, profiling, and tracing.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Learn about observability sources, including: /proc, /sys, tracepoints, kprobes, uprobes, USDT, and PMCs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Learn how to configure sar(1) for archiving statistics.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">In <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a> I introduced different types of observability: counters, profiling, and tracing, as well as static and dynamic instrumentation. This chapter explains observability tools and their data sources in detail, including a summary of sar(1), the system activity reporter, and an introduction to tracing tools. This gives you the essentials for understanding Linux observability; later chapters (<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">6</a> to <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">11</a>) use these tools and sources to solve specific issues. <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapters 13</a> to <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">15</a> cover the tracers in depth.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This chapter uses the Ubuntu Linux distribution as an example; most of these tools are the same across other Linux distributions, and some similar tools exist for other kernels and operating systems where these tools originated.</p>

        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch04fn1" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn1a">1</a></sup>When teaching performance classes in the mid-2000s, I would draw my own kernel diagram on a whiteboard and annotate it with the different performance tools and what they observed. I found it an effective way for explaining tool coverage as a form of mental map. I’ve since published digital versions of these, which adorn cubicle walls around the world.

        <p class="noindent">Most of these tools focus on a particular resource, such as CPU, memory, or disks, and are covered in a later chapter dedicated to that resource. There are some multi-tools that can analyze many areas, and they are introduced later in this chapter: perf, Ftrace, BCC, and bpftrace.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev1sec1">4.1.1 Static Performance Tools</h4>
        <p class="noindent">There is another type of observability that examines attributes of the system at rest rather than under active workload. This was described as the <em>static performance tuning</em> methodology in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Methodologies</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02lev5sec17">Section 2.5.17</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02lev5sec17">Static Performance Tuning</a>, and these tools are shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig02">Figure 4.2</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev1sec2">4.1.2 Crisis Tools</h4>
        <p class="noindent">When you have a production performance crisis that requires various performance tools to debug it, you might find that none of them are installed. Worse, since the server is suffering a performance issue, installing the tools may take much longer than usual, prolonging the crisis.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For Linux, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04tab01">Table 4.1</a> lists the recommended installation packages or source repositories that provide these <em>crisis tools</em>. Package names for Ubuntu/Debian are shown in this table (these package names may vary for different Linux distributions).</p>

        <p class="noindent">Large companies, such as Netflix, have OS and performance teams who ensure that production systems have all of these packages installed. A default Linux distribution may only have procps and util-linux installed, so all the others must be added.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In container environments, it may be desirable to create a privileged debugging container that has full access to the system<sup><a id="ch04fn2a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn2">2</a></sup> and all tools installed. The image for this container can be installed on container hosts and deployed when needed.</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch04fn2" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn2a">2</a></sup>It could also be configured to share namespaces with a target container to analyze.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Adding tool packages is often not enough: kernel and user-space software may also need to be configured to support these tools. Tracing tools typically require certain kernel CONFIG options to be enabled, such as CONFIG_FTRACE and CONFIG_BPF. Profiling tools typically require software to be configured to support stack walking, either by using frame-pointer compiled versions of all software (including system libraries: libc, libpthread, etc.) or debuginfo packages installed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133"></span>to support dwarf stack walking. If your company has yet to do this, you should check that each performance tool works and fix those that do not before they are urgently needed in a crisis.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev2">4.2 Tool Types</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A useful categorization for observability tools is whether they provide <em>system-wide</em> or <em>per-process</em> observability, and whether they are based on counters or <em>events</em>. These attributes are shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig03">Figure 4.3</a>, along with Linux tool examples.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">Some tools fit in more than one quadrant; for example, top(1) also has a system-wide summary, and system-wide event tools can often filter for a particular process (<code>-p PID</code>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Event-based tools include profilers and tracers<em>.</em> Profilers observe activity by taking a series of snapshots on events, painting a coarse picture of the target. Tracers instrument every event of interest, and may perform processing on them, for example to generate customized counters. Counters, tracing, and profiling were introduced in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following sections describe Linux tools that use fixed counters, tracing, and profiling, as well as those that perform monitoring (metrics).</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">4.2.1 Fixed Counters</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Kernels maintain various counters for providing system statistics. They are usually implemented as unsigned integers that are incremented when events occur. For example, there are counters for the number of network packets received, disk I/O issued, and interrupts that occurred. These are exposed by monitoring software as <em>metrics</em> (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev2sec4">Section 4.2.4</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev2sec4">Monitoring</a>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">A common kernel approach is to maintain a pair of cumulative counters: one to count events and the other to record the total time in the event. These provide the count of events directly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134"></span>and the average time (or latency) in the event, by dividing the total time by the count. Since they are cumulative, by reading the pair at a time interval (e.g., one second) the delta can be calculated, and from that the per-second count and average latency. This is how many system statistics are calculated.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Performance-wise, counters are considered “free” to use since they are enabled by default and maintained continually by the kernel. The only additional cost when using them is the act of reading their values from user-space (which should be negligible). The following example tools read these system-wide or per process.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_1">System-Wide</h5>
        <p class="noindent">These tools examine system-wide activity in the context of system software or hardware resources, using kernel counters. Linux tools include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>vmstat(8)</strong>: Virtual and physical memory statistics, system-wide</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>mpstat(1)</strong>: Per-CPU usage</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>iostat(1)</strong>: Per-disk I/O usage, reported from the block device interface</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>nstat(8)</strong>: TCP/IP stack statistics</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>sar(1)</strong>: Various statistics; can also archive them for historical reporting</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">These tools are typically viewable by all users on the system (non-root). Their statistics are also commonly graphed by monitoring software.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Many follow a usage convention where they accept an optional <em>interval</em> and <em>count</em>, for example, vmstat(8) with an interval of one second and an output count of three:</p>

        <p class="noindent">The first line of output is the summary-since-boot, which shows averages for the entire time the system has been up. The subsequent lines are the one-second interval summaries, showing current activity. At least, this is the intent: this Linux version mixes summary-since-boot and current values for the first line (the memory columns are current values; vmstat(8) is explained in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>).</p>

        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_2">Per-Process</h5>
        <p class="noindent">These tools are process-oriented and use counters that the kernel maintains for each process. Linux tools include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>ps(1):</strong> Shows process status, shows various process statistics, including memory and CPU usage.</p></li>

        <li><p class="bull"><strong>pmap(1):</strong> Lists process memory segments with usage statistics.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">These tools typically read statistics from the /proc file system.</p>
        </section>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2">4.2.2 Profiling</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Profiling characterizes the target by collecting a set of samples or snapshots of its behavior. CPU usage is a common target of profiling, where timer-based samples are taken of the instruction pointer or stack trace to characterize CPU-consuming code paths. These samples are usually collected at a fixed rate, such as 100 Hz (cycles per second) across all CPUs, and for a short duration such as one minute. Profiling tools, or <em>profilers</em>, often use 99 Hz instead of 100 Hz to avoid sampling in lockstep with target activity, which could lead to over- or undercounting.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Profiling can also be based on untimed hardware events, such as CPU hardware cache misses or bus activity. It can show which code paths are responsible, information that can especially help developers optimize their code for memory usage.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Unlike fixed counters, profiling (and tracing) are typically only enabled on an as-needed basis, since they can cost some CPU overhead to collect, and storage overhead to store. The magnitudes of these overheads depend on the tool and the rate of events it instruments. Timer-based profilers are generally safer: the event rate is known, so its overhead can be predicted, and the event rate can be selected to have negligible overhead.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_3">System-Wide</h5>
        <p class="noindent">System-wide Linux profilers include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>perf(1)</strong>: The standard Linux profiler, which includes profiling subcommands.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>profile(8)</strong>: A BPF-based CPU profiler from the BCC repository (covered in <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>, <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">BPF</a>) that frequency counts stack traces in kernel context.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Intel VTune Amplifier XE</strong>: Linux and Windows profiling, with a graphical interface including source browsing.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">These can also be used to target a single process.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Process-oriented profilers include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>gprof(1)</strong>: The GNU profiling tool, which analyzes profiling information added by compilers (e.g., <code>gcc -pg</code>).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>cachegrind</strong>: A tool from the valgrind toolkit, can profile hardware cache usage (and more) and visualize profiles using kcachegrind.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Java Flight Recorder (JFR)</strong>: Programming languages often have their own special-purpose profilers that can inspect language context. For example, JFR for Java.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">Tracing instruments every occurrence of an event, and can store event-based details for later analysis or produce a summary. This is similar to profiling, but the intent is to collect or inspect all events, not just a sample. Tracing can incur higher CPU and storage overheads than profiling, which can slow the target of tracing. This should be taken into consideration, as it may negatively affect the production workload, and measured timestamps may also be skewed by the tracer. As with profiling, tracing is typically only used as needed.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><em>Logging</em>, where infrequent events such as errors and warnings are written to a log file for later reading, can be thought of as low-frequency tracing that <em>is</em> enabled by default. Logs include the system log.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following are examples of system-wide and per-process tracing tools.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_5">System-Wide</h5>
        <p class="noindent">These tracing tools examine system-wide activity in the context of system software or hardware resources, using kernel tracing facilities. Linux tools include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>tcpdump(8)</strong>: Network packet tracing (uses libpcap)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>biosnoop(8)</strong>: Block I/O tracing (uses BCC or bpftrace)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>execsnoop(8)</strong>: New processes tracing (uses BCC or bpftrace)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>perf(1)</strong>: The standard Linux profiler, can also trace events</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><code>perf trace</code></strong>: A special perf subcommand that traces system calls system-wide</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Ftrace</strong>: The Linux built-in tracer</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_018">BCC</a></strong>: A BPF-based tracing library and toolkit</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>bpftrace</strong>: A BPF-based tracer (bpftrace(8)) and toolkit</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">perf(1), Ftrace, BCC, and bpftrace are introduced in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev5">Section 4.5</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev5">Tracing Tools</a>, and covered in detail in <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapters 13</a> to <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">15</a>. There are over one hundred tracing tools built using BCC and bpftrace, including biosnoop(8) and execsnoop(8) from this list. More examples are provided throughout this book.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_6">Per-Process</h5>
        <p class="noindent">These tracing tools are process-oriented, as are the operating system frameworks on which they are based. Linux tools include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>strace(1)</strong>: System call tracing</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>gdb(1)</strong>: A source-level debugger</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The debuggers can examine per-event data, but they must do so by stopping and starting the execution of the target. This can come with an enormous overhead cost, making them unsuitable for production use.</p>
        <p class="noindent">System-wide tracing tools such as perf(1) and bpftrace support filters for examining a single process and can operate with much lower overhead, making them preferred where available.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Monitoring was introduced in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Methodologies</a>. Unlike the tool types covered previously, monitoring records statistics continuously in case they are later needed.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_7">sar(1)</h5>
        <p class="noindent">A traditional tool for monitoring a single operating system host is the System Activity Reporter, sar(1), originating from AT&amp;T Unix. sar(1) is counter-based and has an agent that executes at scheduled times (via cron) to record the state of system-wide counters. The sar(1) tool allows these to be viewed at the command line, for example:</p>

        <p class="noindent">sar(1) can record dozens of different statistics to provide insight into CPU, memory, disks, networking, interrupts, power usage, and more. It is covered in more detail in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev4">Section 4.4</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev4">sar</a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Third-party monitoring products are often built on sar(1) or the same observability statistics it uses, and expose these metrics over the network.</p>

        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_8">SNMP</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The traditional technology for network monitoring is the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Devices and operating systems can support SNMP and in some cases provide it by default, avoiding the need to install third-party agents or exporters. SNMP includes many basic OS metrics, although it has not been extended to cover modern applications. Most environments have been switching to custom agent-based monitoring instead.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_9">Agents</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Modern monitoring software runs agents (also known as <em>exporters</em> or <em>plugins</em>) on each system to record kernel and application metrics. These can include agents for specific applications and targets, for example, the MySQL database server, the Apache Web Server, and the Memcached caching system. Such agents can provide detailed application request metrics that are not available from system counters alone.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"></span>Monitoring software and agents for Linux include:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)</strong>: PCP supports dozens of different agents (called Performance Metric Domain Agents: PMDAs), including for BPF-based metrics <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref14">[PCP 20]</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Prometheus</strong>: The Prometheus monitoring software supports dozens of different exporters, for databases, hardware, messaging, storage, HTTP, APIs, and logging <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref15">[Prometheus 20]</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>collectd</strong>: Supports dozens of different plugins.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">An example monitoring architecture is pictured in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig04">Figure 4.4</a> involving a monitoring database server for archiving metrics, and a monitoring web server for providing a client UI. The metrics are sent (or made available) by agents to the database server and then made available to client UIs for display in as line graphs and in dashboards. For example, Graphite Carbon is a monitoring database server, and Grafana is a monitoring web server/dashboard.</p>

        <p class="noindent">There are dozens of monitoring products, and hundreds of different agents for different target types. Covering them is beyond the scope of this book. There is, however, one common denominator that is covered here: system statistics (based on kernel counters). The system statistics shown by monitoring products are typically the same as those shown by system tools: vmstat(8), iostat(1), etc. Learning these will help you understand monitoring products, even if you never use the command-line tools. These tools are covered in later chapters.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Some monitoring products read their system metrics by running the system tools and parsing the text output, which is inefficient. Better monitoring products use library and kernel interfaces to read the metrics directly—the same interfaces as used by the command-line tools. These sources are covered in the next section, focusing on the most common denominator: the kernel interfaces.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev3sec1">4.3.1 /proc</h4>
        <p class="noindent">This is a file system interface for kernel statistics. /proc contains a number of directories, where each directory is named after the process ID for the process it represents. In each of these directories is a number of files containing information and statistics about each process, mapped from kernel data structures. There are additional files in /proc for system-wide statistics.</p>
        <p class="noindent">/proc is dynamically created by the kernel and is not backed by storage devices (it runs in-memory). It is mostly read-only, providing statistics for observability tools. Some files are writeable, for controlling process and kernel behavior.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The file system interface is convenient: it’s an intuitive framework for exposing kernel statistics to user-land via the directory tree, and has a well-known programming interface via the POSIX file system calls: open(), read(), close(). You can also explore it at the command line using <code>cd</code>, cat(1), grep(1), and awk(1). The file system also provides user-level security through use of file access permissions. In rare cases where the typical process observability tools (ps(1), top(1), etc.) cannot be executed, some process debugging can still be performed by shell built-ins from the /proc directory.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The overhead of reading most /proc files is negligible; exceptions include some memory-map related files that walk page tables.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The /proc/stat file provides system-wide CPU utilization statistics and is used by many tools (vmstat(8), mpstat(1), sar(1), monitoring agents). The accuracy of these statistics depends on the kernel configuration. The default configuration (CONFIG_TICK_CPU_ACCOUNTING) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143"></span>measures CPU utilization with a granularity of clock ticks <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref5">[Weisbecker 13]</a>, which may be four milliseconds (depending on CONFIG_HZ). This is generally sufficient. There are options to improve accuracy by using higher-resolution counters, though with a small performance cost (VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE and VIRT_CPU_ACCOUTING_GEN), as well an option to for more accurate IRQ time (IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING). A different approach to obtaining accurate CPU utilization measurements is to use MSRs or PMCs.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Tracepoints are a Linux kernel event source based on <em>static instrumentation</em>, a term introduced in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Introduction</a>, <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev7sec3">Section 1.7.3</a>, <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev7sec3">Tracing</a>. Tracepoints are hard-coded instrumentation points placed at logical locations in kernel code. For example, there are tracepoints at the start and end of system calls, scheduler events, file system operations, and disk I/O.<sup><a id="ch04fn4a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn4">4</a></sup> The tracepoint infrastructure was developed by Mathieu Desnoyers and first made available in the Linux 2.6.32 release in 2009. Tracepoints are a stable API<sup><a id="ch04fn5a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn5">5</a></sup> and are limited in number.</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch04fn4" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn4a">4</a></sup>Some are gated by Kconfig options and may not be available if the kernel is compiled without them; e.g., rcu tracepoints and CONFIG_RCU_TRACE.</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch04fn5" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn5a">5</a></sup>I’d call it “best-effort stable.” It is rare, but I have seen tracepoints change.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Tracepoints are an important resource for performance analysis as they power advanced tracing tools that go beyond summary statistics, providing deeper insight into kernel behavior. While function-based tracing can provide a similar power (e.g., <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev3sec6">Section 4.3.6</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev3sec6">kprobes</a>), only tracepoints provide a stable interface, allowing robust tools to be developed.</p>

TRACE_EVENT also defines and formats its arguments, auto-generates the trace_sched_wakeup() code, and places the trace event in the tracefs and perf_event_open(2) interfaces <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref17">[Ts’o 20]</a>. Tracing tools primarily instrument trace events, although they may refer to them as “tracepoints.” perf(1) calls trace events “Tracepoint event,” which is confusing since kprobe- and uprobe-based trace events are also labeled “Tracepoint event.”</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_16">Tracepoints Overhead</h5>
        <p class="noindent">When tracepoints are activated, they add a small amount of CPU overhead to each event. The tracing tool may also add CPU overhead to post-process events, plus file system overheads to record them. Whether the overheads are high enough to perturb production applications depends on the rate of events and the number of CPUs, and is something you will need to consider when using tracepoints.</p>
        <p class="noindent">On typical systems of today (4 to 128 CPUs), I find that event rates of less than 10,000 per second cost negligible overhead, and only over 100,000 does the overhead begin to become measurable. As event examples, you may find that disk events are typically fewer than 10,000 per second, but scheduler events can be well over 100,000 per second and therefore can be expensive to trace.</p>
        <p class="noindent">I’ve previously analyzed overheads for a particular system and found the minimum tracepoint overhead to be 96 nanoseconds of CPU time [Gregg 19]. There is a new type of tracepoint called <em>raw tracepoints</em>, added to Linux 4.7 in 2018, which avoids the cost of creating stable tracepoint arguments, reducing this overhead.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Apart from the enabled overhead while tracepoints are in use, there is also the disabled overhead for making them available. A disabled tracepoint becomes a small number of instructions: for x86_64 it is a 5-byte no-operation (nop) instruction. There is also a tracepoint handler added to the end of the function, which increases its text size a little. While these overheads are very small, they are something you should analyze and understand when adding tracepoints to the kernel.</p>

They are considered an unstable API because they expose raw kernel functions and arguments that may change between kernel versions.</p>
        <p class="noindent">kprobes can work in different ways internally. The standard method is to modify the instruction text of running kernel code to insert instrumentation where needed. When instrumenting the entry of functions, an optimization may be used where kprobes make use of existing Ftrace function tracing, as it has lower overhead.<sup><a id="ch04fn7a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn7">7</a></sup></p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch04fn7" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn7a">7</a></sup>It can also be enabled/disabled via the debug.kprobes-optimization sysctl(8).</p>
        <p class="noindent">kprobes are important because they are a last-resort<sup><a id="ch04fn8a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn8">8</a></sup> source of virtually unlimited information about kernel behavior in production, which can be crucial for observing performance issues that are invisible to other tools. They can be used by the tracers introduced in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev5">Section 4.5</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev5">Tracing Tools</a>, and are covered in depth in <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapters 13</a> to <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">15</a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155"></span>uprobes currently work by trapping into the kernel. This costs much higher CPU overheads than kprobes or tracepoints. For a particular system I measured, the minimum uprobe cost 1,287 nanoseconds, and the minimum uretprobe cost 1,931 nanoseconds [Gregg 19]. The uretprobe overhead is higher because it is a uprobe plus a trampoline function.</p>

        <p class="noindent">User-level statically-defined tracing (USDT) is the user-space version of tracepoints. USDT is to uprobes as tracepoints is to kprobes. Some applications and libraries have added USDT probes to their code, providing a stable (and documented) API for tracing application-level events. For example, there are USDT probes in the Java JDK, in the PostgreSQL database, and in libc. The following lists OpenJDK USDT probes using bpftrace:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch04_images.xhtml#pg155a" id="pg155">Click here to view code image</a></p>

        [...]</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This lists USDT probes for Java class loading and unloading, method compilation, and garbage collection. Many more were truncated: the full listing shows 524 USDT probes for this JDK version.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Many applications already have custom event logs that can be enabled and configured, and are useful for performance analysis. What makes USDT probes different is that they can be used from various tracers that can combine application context with kernel events such as disk and network I/O. An application-level logger may tell you that a database query was slow due to file system I/O, but a tracer can reveal more information: e.g., the query was slow due to lock contention in the file system, and not disk I/O as you might have assumed.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Some applications contain USDT probes, but they are not currently enabled in the packaged version of the application (this is the case with OpenJDK). Using them requires rebuilding the application from source with the appropriate config option. That option may be called --enable-dtrace-probes after the DTrace tracer, which drove adoption of USDT in applications.</p>
        <p class="noindent">USDT probes must be compiled into the executable they instrument. This is not possible for JIT-compiled languages such as Java, which usually compiles on the fly. A solution to this is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156"></span><em>dynamic USDT</em>, which precompiles probes as a shared library, and provides an interface to call them from the JIT-compiled language. Dynamic USDT libraries exist for Java, Node.js, and other languages. Interpreted languages have a similar problem and need for dynamic USDT.</p>
        <p class="noindent">USDT probes are implemented in Linux using uprobes: see the previous section for a description of uprobes and their overhead. In addition to the enabled overhead, USDT probes place nop instructions in the code, as do tracepoints.</p>
        <p class="noindent">USDT probes can be used by the tracers introduced in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev5">Section 4.5</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev5">Tracing Tools</a>, covered in depth in <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapters 13</a> to <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">15</a> (although using USDT with Ftrace requires some extra work).</p>

        <p class="noindent">The processor and other devices commonly support hardware counters for observing activity. The main source are the processors, where they are commonly called <em>performance monitoring counters</em> (PMCs). They are known by other names as well: <em>CPU performance counters</em> (CPCs), <em>performance instrumentation counters</em> (PICs), and <em>performance monitoring unit events</em> (PMU events). These all refer to the same thing: programmable hardware registers on the processor that provide low-level performance information at the CPU cycle level.</p>
        <p class="noindent">PMCs are a vital resource for performance analysis. Only through PMCs can you measure the efficiency of CPU instructions, the hit ratios of CPU caches, the utilization of memory and device buses, interconnect utilization, stall cycles, and so on. Using these to analyze performance can lead to various performance optimizations.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_30">PMC Interface</h5>
        <p class="noindent">On Linux PMCs are accessed via the perf_event_open(2) syscall and are consumed by tools including perf(1).</p>
        <p class="noindent">While there are hundreds of PMCs available, there is only a fixed number of registers available in the CPUs to measure them at the same time, perhaps as few as six. You need to choose which PMCs you’d like to measure on those six registers, or cycle through different PMC sets as a way of sampling them (Linux perf(1) supports this automatically). Other software counters do not suffer from these constraints.</p>
        <p class="noindent">PMCs can be used in different modes: <em>counting</em>, where they count events with practically zero overhead; and <em>overflow sampling</em>, where an interrupt is raised for one in every configurable number of events, so that state can be captured. Counting can be used to quantify problems; overflow sampling can be used to show the code path responsible.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158"></span>perf(1) can perform counting using the <code>stat</code> subcommand, and sampling using the <code>record</code> subcommand; see <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">perf</a>.</p>

        <section>
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_31">PMC Challenges</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Two common challenges when using PMCs are their accuracy for overflow sampling and their availability in cloud environments.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Overflow sampling may not record the correct instruction pointer that triggered the event, due to interrupt latency (often called “skid”) or out-of-order instruction execution. For CPU cycle profiling, such skid may not be a problem, and some profilers deliberately introduce jitter to avoid lockstep sampling (or use an offset sampling rate such as 99 Hertz). But for measuring other events, such as LLC misses, the sampled instruction pointer needs to be accurate.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The solution is processor support for what are known as <em>precise events</em>. On Intel, precise events use a technology called precise event-based sampling (PEBS),<sup><a id="ch04fn9a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn9">9</a></sup> which uses hardware buffers to record a more accurate (“precise”) instruction pointer at the time of the PMC event. On AMD, precise events use instruction-based sampling (IBS) <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref2">[Drongowski 07]</a>. The Linux perf(1) command supports precise events (see <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">perf</a>, <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13lev9sec2">Section 13.9.2</a>, <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13lev9sec2">CPU Profiling</a>).</p>
        <p class="footnote"><sup><a id="ch04fn9" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn9a">9</a></sup>Some of Intel’s documentation expands PEBS differently, as: processor event-based sampling.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another challenge is cloud computing, as many cloud environments disable PMC access for their guests. It is technically possible to enable it: for example, the Xen hypervisor has the <code>vpmu</code> command line option, which allows different sets of PMCs to be exposed to guests<sup><a id="ch04fn10a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn10">10</a></sup> <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref18">[Xenbits 20]</a>. Amazon have enabled many PMCs for their Nitro hypervisor guests.<sup><a id="ch04fn11a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn11">11</a></sup> Also, some cloud providers offer “bare-metal instances” where the guest has full processor access, and therefore full PMC access.</p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch04fn10" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn10a">10</a></sup>I wrote the Xen code that allows different PMC modes: “ipc” for instructions-per-cycle PMCs only, and “arch” for the Intel architectural set. My code was just a firewall on the existing vpmu support in Xen.</p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch04fn11" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn11a">11</a></sup>Currently only for larger Nitro instances where the VM owns a full processor socket (or more).</p>

        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Network sniffing (libpcap)</strong>: These interfaces provide a way to capture packets from network devices for detailed investigations into packet and protocol performance. On Linux, sniffing is provided via the libpcap library and /proc/net/dev and is consumed by the tcpdump(8) tool. There are overheads, both CPU and storage, for capturing and examining all packets. See <a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a> for more about network sniffing.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>netfilter conntrack</strong>: The Linux netfilter technology allows custom handlers to be executed on events, not just for firewall, but also for connection tracking (conntrack). This allows logs to be created of network flows <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref3">[Ayuso 12]</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Process accounting</strong>: This dates back to mainframes and the need to bill departments and users for their computer usage, based on the execution and runtime of processes. It exists in some form for Linux and other systems and can sometimes be helpful for performance analysis at the process level. For example, the Linux atop(1) tool uses process accounting to catch and display information from short-lived processes that would otherwise be missed when taking snapshots of /proc <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref10">[Atoptool 20]</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Software events</strong>: These are related to hardware events but are instrumented in software. Page faults are an example. Software events are made available via the perf_event_open(2) interface and are used by perf(1) and bpftrace. They are pictured in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig05">Figure 4.5</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_172">System calls</a></strong>: Some system or library calls may be available to provide some performance metrics. These include getrusage(2), a system call for processes to get their own resource usage statistics, including user- and system-time, faults, messages, and context switches.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">If you are interested in how each of these works, you will find that documentation is usually available, intended for the developer who is building tools upon these interfaces.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_33">And More</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Depending on your kernel version and enabled options, even more observability sources may be available. Some are mentioned in later chapters of this book. For Linux these include I/O accounting, blktrace, timer_stats, lockstat, and debugfs.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160"></span>One way to find such sources is to read the kernel code you are interested in observing and see what statistics or tracepoints have been placed there.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In some cases there may be no kernel statistics for what you are after. Beyond dynamic instrumentation (Linux kprobes and uprobes), you may find that debuggers such as gdb(1) and lldb(1) can fetch kernel and application variables to shed some light on an investigation.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3_34">Solaris Kstat</h5>
        <p class="noindent">As an example of a different way to provide system statistics, Solaris-based systems use a kernel statistics (Kstat) framework that provides a consistent hierarchical structure of kernel statistics, each named using the following four-tuple:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch04_images.xhtml#pg160-1a" id="pg160-1">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pretb"><em>module:instance:name:statistic</em></pre>
        <p class="noindent">These are</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><em>module</em></strong>: This usually refers to the kernel module that created the statistic, such as sd for the SCSI disk driver, or zfs for the ZFS file system.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><em><a href="gloss.xhtml#glo_082">instance</a></em></strong>: Some modules exist as multiple instances, such as an sd module for each SCSI disk. The instance is an enumeration.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><em>name</em></strong>: This is a name for the group of statistics.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong><em>statistic</em></strong>: This is the individual statistic name.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Kstats are accessed using a binary kernel interface, and various libraries exist.</p>
        <p class="noindent">As an example Kstat, the following reads the “nproc” statistic using kstat(1M) and specifying the full four-tuple:</p>

        <pre class="pretb">$ <strong>kstat -p unix:0:system_misc:nproc</strong>
        unix:0:system_misc:nproc        94</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This statistic shows the currently running number of processes.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In comparison, the /proc/stat-style sources on Linux have inconsistent formatting and usually require text parsing to process, costing some CPU cycles.</p>

        <p class="noindent">sar(1) was introduced in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev2sec4">Section 4.2.4</a>, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04lev2sec4">Monitoring</a>, as a key monitoring facility. While there has been much excitement recently with BPF tracing superpowers (and I’m partly responsible), you should not overlook the utility of sar(1)—it’s an essential systems performance tool that can solve many performance issues on its own. The Linux version of sar(1) is also well-designed, having self-descriptive column headings, network metric groups, and detailed documentation (man pages).</p>

        <p class="noindent">The schedule of statistic recording can be modified in the crontab file for sysstat:</p>

You can adjust this to suit the resolution desired: the syntax is documented in the crontab(5) man page. More frequent data collection will increase the size of the sar(1) archive files, which can be found in /var/log/sysstat.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The <code>*/5</code> will record every five minutes, and the <code>-S ALL</code> will record all statistics. By default sar(1) will record most (but not all) statistic groups. The <code>-S ALL</code> option is used to record all statistic groups—it is passed to sadc(1), and documented in the man page for sadc(1). There is also an extended version, <code>-S XALL</code>, which records additional breakdowns of statistics.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Linux tracing tools use the previously described events interfaces (tracepoints, kprobes, uprobes, USDT) for advanced performance analysis. The main tracing tools are:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>perf(1)</strong>: The official Linux profiler. It is excellent for CPU profiling (sampling of stack traces) and PMC analysis, and can instrument other events, typically recording to an output file for post-processing.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Ftrace</strong>: The official Linux tracer, it is a multi-tool composed of different tracing utilities. It is suited for kernel code path analysis and resource-constrained systems, as it can be used without dependencies.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>BPF (BCC, bpftrace)</strong>: Extended BPF was introduced in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Operating Systems</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03lev4sec4">Section 3.4.4</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03lev4sec4">Extended BPF</a>. It powers advanced tracing tools, the main ones being BCC and bpftrace. BCC provides powerful tools, and bpftrace provides a high-level language for custom one-liners and short programs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>SystemTap</strong>: A high-level language and tracer with many tapsets (libraries) for tracing different targets <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref1">[Eigler 05]</a><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref16">[Sourceware 20]</a>. It has recently been developing a BPF backend, which I recommend (see the stapbpf(8) man page).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>LTTng</strong>: A tracer optimized for black-box recording: optimally recording many events for later analysis <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref13">[LTTng 20]</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The first three tracers are covered in <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>, <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">perf</a>; <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>, <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Ftrace</a>; and <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>, <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">BPF</a>. The chapters that now follow (5 to 12) include various uses of these tracers, showing the commands to type and how to interpret the output. This ordering is deliberate, focusing on uses and performance wins first, and then covering the tracers in more detail later if and as needed.</p>
        <p class="noindent">At Netflix, I use perf(1) for CPU analysis, Ftrace for kernel code digging, and BCC/bpftrace for everything else (memory, file systems, disks, networking, and application tracing).</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167"></span>4.6 Observing Observability</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Observability tools and the statistics upon which they are built are implemented in software, and all software has the potential for bugs. The same is true for the documentation that describes the software. Regard with a healthy skepticism any statistics that are new to you, questioning what they really mean and whether they are really correct.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Metrics may be subject to any of the following problems:</p>
        <ul class="sq">
        <li><p class="bull">Tools and measurements are sometimes wrong.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Man pages are not always right.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Available metrics may be incomplete.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Available metrics may be poorly designed and confusing.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Metric collectors (e.g., that parse tool output) can have bugs.<sup><a id="ch04fn13a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn13">13</a></sup></p>
        <p class="footnote1"><sup><a id="ch04fn13" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fn13a">13</a></sup>In this case the tool and measurement are correct, but an automated collector has introduced errors. At Surge 2013 I gave a lightning talk on an astonishing case <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04ref4">[Gregg 13c]</a>: a benchmarking company reported poor metrics for a product I was supporting, and I dug in. It turned out the shell script they used to automate the benchmark had two bugs. First, when processing output from fio(1), it would take a result such as “100KB/s” and use a regular expression to elide nun-numeric characters, including “KB/s” to turn this into “100”. Since fio(1) reported results with different units (bytes, Kbytes, Mbytes), this introduced massive (1024x) errors. Second, they also elided decimal places, so a result of “1.6” became “16”.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="bull">Metric processing (algorithms/spreadsheets) can also introduce errors.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">When multiple observability tools have overlapping coverage, you can use them to cross-check each other. Ideally, they will source different instrumentation frameworks to check for bugs in the frameworks as well. Dynamic instrumentation is especially useful for this purpose, as custom tools can be created to double-check metrics.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another verification technique is to apply <em>known workloads</em> and then to check that the observability tools agree with the results you expect. This can involve the use of micro-benchmarking tools that report their own statistics for comparison.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Sometimes it isn’t the tool or statistic that is in error, but the documentation that describes it, including man pages. The software may have evolved without the documentation being updated.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Realistically, you may not have time to double-check every performance measurement you use and will do this only if you encounter unusual results or a result that is company critical. Even if you do not double-check, it can be valuable to be aware that you didn’t and that you assumed the tools were correct.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Metrics can also be incomplete. When faced with a large number of tools and metrics, it may be tempting to assume that they provide complete and effective coverage. This is often not the case: metrics may have been added by programmers to debug their own code, and later built into observability tools without much study of real customer needs. Some programmers may not have added any at all to new subsystems.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"></span>An absence of metrics can be more difficult to identify than the presence of poor metrics. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Methodologies</a>, can help you find these missing metrics by studying the questions you need answered for performance analysis.</p>
