        <p>In this chapter, we’ll give you an introduction to the concepts and principles of this book.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="practices and principles over technology" id="idm45816839670056"></a> A good way of summarizing the overall approach is <em>Practices and Principles over Technology</em>.
        There are already many books about specific technologies, and we aren’t seeking to add to that enormous pile. That isn’t to say that the detailed knowledge that is specific to a given
        language, framework, or library isn’t useful. It’s just that it has a shorter shelf-life than general practices and principles that apply over longer periods of time and across different languages and frameworks. That’s where this book can help you.</p>

        <h1>Themes</h1>
        
        <p>Throughout the book we’ve used a project-based structure to aid learning.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="themes" id="ix_them"></a> It’s worth thinking
        about the different themes that run through the chapters, how they link up together, and why
        we chose them.
        Following are the four different themes that weave through the chapters.</p>

        <h2>Java Features</h2>
        
        <p>Structuring code with classes and interfaces is discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#chapter_02">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>. We move<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Java" data-secondary="features" id="idm45816839662936"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="themes" data-secondary="Java features" id="idm45816839661960"></a> onto
        exceptions and packages in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter_03">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>. You will also get a short overview of lambda expressions in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter_03">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>. Then local variable type inferences and switch expressions are explained in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#chapter_05">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, and finally lambda expressions and method references are covered in detail in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter_07">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>. Java language features are important because so many software
        projects are written in Java, so it’s useful language to know the workings of it. Many of these
        language features are useful in other programming languages as well, such as C#, C++, Ruby, or Python.
        Even though those languages have differences, understanding the how to use a class and core OOP
        concepts will be valuable across different languages.</p>

        <h2>Software Design and Architecture</h2>
        
        <p>Throughout the book a series of design patterns are introduced that help provide you with common
        solutions to common problems that developers encounter.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="software design and architecture" id="idm45816839655544"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="themes" data-secondary="software design and architecture" id="idm45816839654824"></a> These are important to know because even
        though it may seem like every software project is different and comes with its own set of problems,
        in practice many of these have been encountered before. Understanding common problems and
        solutions that have <span class="keep-together">been solved</span> by developers keeps you from reinventing the wheel in a new
        software project and enables you to deliver software faster and more reliably.</p>
        
        <p>The higher-level concepts of coupling and cohesion are introduced early on the book in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#chapter_02">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>. The Notification pattern is introduced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#chapter_03">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>. How to design a user-friendly Fluent API and the Builder pattern are introduced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#chapter_05">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.
        We look at the big-picture concepts of event-driven and hexagonal architectures in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#chapter_06">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> and the Repository pattern in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter_07">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>.

        <p>As a software developer you may well approach projects in an iterative fashion.
        That’s to say, slice off the highest priority week or two’s worth of work items,
        implement them, and then use the feedback in order to decide on the next set of items.
