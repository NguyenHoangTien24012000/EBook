However, JavaScript differs from most other languages for certain specific features which can create some concern to the developers used to working with programming languages that implement the classical OOP.</p><p>The first of these features is the dynamic nature of the language both in data type management and object creation. Since data types are dynamically evaluated, some features of OOP, such as polymorphism, are implicitly supported. Moreover, the ability to change an object structure at runtime breaks the common sense that binds an object to a more abstract entity such as a class.</p><p>The lack of the concept of class is another big difference with the classical OOP. Of course, we are talking about the class generalization, nothing to do with the <code class="literal">class</code> construct introduced by ES6 that represents just a syntactic convenience for standard JavaScript constructors.</p><p>Classes in most Object-Oriented languages represent a <span class="emphasis"><em>generalization</em></span> of objects, that is, an extra level of abstraction upon the objects.</p><p>So, classical Object-Oriented programming has two types of abstractions—classes and objects. An object is an abstraction of a real-world entity while a class is an abstraction of an object or another class (in other words, it is a generalization). Objects in classical OOP languages can only be created by instantiating classes.</p><p>JavaScript has a different approach to object management. It has just one type of abstraction—the objects. Unlike the classical OOP approach, an object can be created directly as an abstraction of a real-world entity or as an abstraction of another object. In the latter case the abstracted object is called prototype. As opposed to the classical OOP approach, the JavaScript approach is sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>Prototypal Object-Oriented  Programming</em></span>.</p><p>Of course, the lack of a notion of class in JavaScript affects the inheritance mechanism. In fact, while in classical OOP inheritance is an operation allowed on classes, in prototypal OOP inheritance is an operation on objects.</p><p>That does not mean that classical OOP is better than prototypal OOP or vice versa. They are simply different approaches. However, we cannot ignore that these differences lead to some impact in the way we manage objects. At least we note that while in classical OOP classes are immutable, that is we cannot add, change, or remove properties or methods at runtime, in prototypal OOP objects and prototypes are extremely flexible. Moreover, classical OOP adds an extra level of abstraction with classes, leading to a more verbose code, while prototypal OOP is more immediate and requires a more compact code.</p></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
