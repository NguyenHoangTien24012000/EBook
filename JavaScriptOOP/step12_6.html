We started analyzing the evolution of JavaScript and the growth of its role not only for web applications but also for other kinds of applications that can run on various environments. We analyzed the main principles that any architecture must follow in order to get not only a working application, but also to be extensible and maintainable.</p><p>We compared old-style web application with Single Page Application architectures and showed the peculiarities and benefits. Then, we described the Zakas/Osmani architecture for scalable JavaScript applications. This architecture tries to apply the SOLID principles in order to create applications that are easier to maintain, thanks to a clear separation of concerns. We examined the components of the architecture and the patterns that can be used to reduce coupling. In particular, we introduced the facade pattern and the mediator pattern.</p><p>We also discussed how cross-cutting features such as logging, authorization checks, and similar jobs should be implemented. We suggested to use techniques inspired by the Aspect-Oriented Programming paradigm. So, we closed the chapter with a hint on the Isomorphic Applications, that is, applications that can be run on the client and on the server.</p><p>This chapter concludes the book, in which we have seen how JavaScript can implement the Object-Oriented Programming principles, even if with its peculiarities. We explored various programming techniques and the most commonly used design patterns in the development of JavaScript applications.</p><p>The scope of the language is increasingly expanding, ranging from web to mobile, desktops, and embedded applications. We are sure that programming with JavaScript will be even more interesting in the coming years and understanding how to apply the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm will be very useful.</p></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
