They are widely used in the development of user interfaces and their basic principle is the separation of concerns. State, logic, and synchronization management are distributed among components that contribute to create a specific architecture promoting flexibility and maintainability. The idea behind separation of concerns in the presentation patterns is to make a clear division between business objects, that are objects that describe the real world, and presentation objects, that are the GUI elements we see on the screen. Business objects should be completely self-contained and work without reference to the presentation. They should also be able to support multiple presentations, possibly simultaneously, like, for example, both graphical and command-line interface.</p><div class="section" title="Model, View, and Controller"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec52"></a>Model, View, and Controller</h2></div></div></div><p>Traditionally, a presentation pattern relies on three components.</p><p>The first component is the <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span>, which are the business objects that contain the information to be presented to the user. The model can be obtained from a service or is persisted in a database. It does not know anything about the way its information will be presented to the user and does not contain any logic. It is just data.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> is the component responsible for displaying the data to the user and for catching&nbsp; user's interaction. It composes the user interface and represents the current state of the model. In a Web application, the view usually corresponds to the HTML markup that describes to the user the current model and allows interactions. The third component can assume different names and roles, depending on the specific pattern. For example, it can be a <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Presenter</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>ViewModel</strong></span>, as in the most known presentation patterns. This component usually contains the logic of the presentation architecture and may coordinate the information flow between the View and Model. In other words, it contributes to the synchronization between the current state and the underlying data model.</p><p>In the following sections, we will discuss the three most known presentation patterns: <span class="strong"><strong>Model-View-Controller</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVC</strong></span>), <span class="strong"><strong>Model-View-Presenter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVP</strong></span>), and the <span class="strong"><strong>Model-View-ViewModel</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVVM</strong></span>). These patterns and their variants are often referred to by <span class="strong"><strong>MV*</strong></span>, indicating that the constant parts of the patterns are the Model and View, although with different responsibilities. We will explore how they implement separation of concerns and implement the same example seen above by following the design principles of the three patterns.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"></a>Note</h3><p>The presentation patterns discussed in this chapter were not included in the GoF patterns. They are usually considered compound patterns that are patterns that can be built by composing other patterns. For example, View and Controller have strategy implementation, View itself can be a composite implementation, and View and Model can be synched through the observer pattern. Due to their wide spread, we will discuss them as if were not compound patterns.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
