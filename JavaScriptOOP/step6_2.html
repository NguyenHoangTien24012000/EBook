They are known as reusable solutions to commonly occurring software design problems. Each pattern is identified by a name and describes a situation where components need to interact with each other to achieve a specific goal.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"></a>Note</h3><p>Design patterns became popular in the mid-nineties after the publishing of the book <span class="emphasis"><em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em></span> by the so-called Gang of Four (GoF): Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.</p></div></div><p>The patterns are described so that they can be reused regardless of the language used to implement it. However, the original patterns and the subsequent ones added in the following years were mainly described for classical Object-Oriented languages. So often, they are described in terms of classes, interfaces, and other traditional constructs. Due to lack of native support for some classical OOP constructs, in JavaScript often we have to adapt them to the dynamic nature of the language, obtaining in many cases a simplification.</p><p>Patterns are usually categorized in groups of similar goals. For example, the original design patterns proposed by the GoF had three categories: creational, structural, and behavioral. In this chapter, you will learn how to implement in JavaScript some of the most known patterns concerning the object creation activity, while we will explore some other design patterns throughout the book.</p></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
