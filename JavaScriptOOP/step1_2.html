We do not have to define a class, but we directly create the object just when we need it, and hopefully we can change its structure during the execution of our script.</p><p>Suppose, we need multiple objects of the same type, for example more person objects, which share the same structure.</p><p>Using the literal notation, we will have to repeat the definition for each object that we want to create, which is essential to identify the single person but unnecessarily repetitive for constant members such as the methods. In other words, using the literal notation in the definition of the objects, we get a non reusable result. For example, if we want to create two person objects, we need to write the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = {name: "John", 
        surname: "Smith", 
        address: { 
          street: "13 Duncannon Street", 
          city: "London", 
          country: "United Kingdom" 
        }, 
        displayFullName = function() { 
          return this.name + " " + this.surname; 
        } 
      }; 
var marioRossi = {name: "Mario", 
         surname: "Rossi", 
         address: { 
           street: "Piazza Colonna 370", 
           city: "Roma", 
           country: "Italy" 
         }, 
         displayFullName = function() { 
           return this.name + " " + this.surname; 
         } 
       }; 
</pre><p>Therefore, in order to avoid defining from scratch objects that have the same structure, we can use a <span class="strong"><strong>constructor</strong></span>—a JavaScript function invoked using the <code class="literal">new</code> operator. Let's see how to create a constructor for the person object with an example:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Person() { 
this.name = ""; 
this.surname = ""; 
this.address = ""; 
this.email = ""; 

this.displayFullName = function() {...}; 

} 
</pre><p>This function defines the properties of our object by assigning them to the <code class="literal">this</code> keyword and setting default values. Even if this constructor may seem useless since it assigns just empty strings to the properties, it defines a common structure to any object created by it. So, in order to create an object of type <code class="literal">person</code>, we will have to call the function by prefixing the <code class="literal">new</code> operator:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = new Person(); 
johnSmith.name = "John"; 
johnSmith.surname = "Smith"; 

var marioRossi = new Person(); 
marioRossi.name = "Mario"; 
marioRossi.surname = "Rossi"; 
</pre><p>In this way, when we want to create multiple objects with the same structure, we will limit ourselves to just set the specific values that distinguish one object from another.</p><p>As you can see, the name given to the constructor is capitalized. This is not a requirement for JavaScript, but a common convention that helps to distinguish regular functions from constructors.</p><p>In the definition of a constructor, we can expect the presence of parameters that can be used in the initialization of our object. For example, consider the following definition of the constructor of the person object:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Person(name, surname) { 
this.name = name; 
this.surname = surname; 
this.address = ""; 
this.email = ""; 
this.displayFullName = function() {...}; 
} 
</pre><p>It allows us to create and initialize an object by specifying values directly in the constructor call, as in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = new Persona("John", "Smith"); 
var marioRossi = new Persona("Mario", "Rossi"); 
</pre><p>It is very important to use the <code class="literal">new</code> operator while creating an object through a constructor. In fact, if we forget it, what we get is not the creation of an object, but the execution of the function, with unpredictable results. For example, suppose that we try to create a person object omitting the <code class="literal">new</code> operator:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = Person(); 
</pre><p>The value of the variable <code class="literal">johnSmith</code> will be <span class="emphasis"><em>undefined</em></span>, since the function <code class="literal">Person()</code> returns no value. In addition, all the properties and methods defined within the body of the function will be assigned to the object represented by <code class="literal">this</code> keyword in the execution context of the function, as can be for example the global object window in a browser. This assignment could redefine the value of variables with the same name causing side effects that are difficult to predict and to debug.</p><p>We can reduce the risk of such oversights by resorting to the use of <span class="strong"><strong>strict mode</strong></span>:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Person() { 
"use strict"; 
... 
} 
</pre><p>In <span class="emphasis"><em>strict mode</em></span>, the value of the object represented by the <code class="literal">this</code> keyword is <span class="emphasis"><em>undefined</em></span> during the execution of the function. This generates a runtime error while trying to access the property of an object that does not exist, thus avoiding unwanted invocations of the constructor.</p><p>Unfortunately, this approach is not sufficient when the constructor is defined inside a namespace:</p><pre class="programlisting">var mankind = { 
... 
Person: function(name, surname) { 
'use strict'; 
this.name = name; 
this.surname = surname; 
... 
} 
}; 

var johnSmith = mankind.Person("John", "Smith"); 
</pre><p>In this case, the <code class="literal">this</code> keyword represents the <code class="literal">mankind</code> object, so we will not have a runtime error that warns us of the incorrect use of the constructor, but the properties <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">surname</code> will be attached to the&nbsp;<code class="literal">mankind</code> object.</p><div class="section" title="The Object() constructor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec7"></a>The Object() constructor</h2></div></div></div><p>We have seen how the use of a constructor offers us a higher level of abstraction in the creation of objects. In this section, we explore a particular constructor provided to&nbsp;us by JavaScript—the <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor.</p><p>This constructor allows us to create a generic object, as shown in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = new Object(); 
person.name = "John"; 
person.surname = "Smith"; 
</pre><p>Here, we use the <code class="literal">new</code> operator to create a new instance of an empty object and then we create properties by assigning values, as in the literal approach.</p><p>Actually, creating an object using the literal notation or creating it by means of the <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor is the same thing. Every object created using the literal notation has <code class="literal">Object()</code> as its implicit constructor. We can realize it by accessing the <code class="literal">constructor</code> property that every object has the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = {}; 
console.log(person.constructor == Object);  //result: true 
</pre><p>The <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor is also able to generate object instances from any JavaScript expression, as shown by the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">var number = new Object(12); 
var anotherNumber = new Object(3*2); 
var string = new Object("test"); 
var person = new Object({name: "John", surname: "Smith"}); 
</pre><p>Apart from the last statement, which is equivalent to the creation of an object via its literal representation, the first three statements create an object from a primitive data type, such as a number or string. The result is not just a numerical value or a string value, but built-in objects specialized in handling numeric values and strings.</p><p>We will return later in the book on the <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor for use in advanced mode.</p></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
