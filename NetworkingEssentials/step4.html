Wireless networking is an extension of computer networks into the radio frequency (RF) world. A WLAN provides increased flexibility and mobility for connecting to a network. A properly designed WLAN for a building provides mobile access for a user from virtually any location in the building. The user doesn’t have to look for a connection to plug into; also, the expense of pulling cables and installing wall plates required for wired networks can be avoided. However, a network administrator must carefully plan a wireless LAN installation and have a good understanding of the issues of using WLAN technologies to ensure the installation of a reliable and secure network.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch4lev1sec1"><span class="space">4-1</span> Introduction</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The objective of this section is to introduce students to wireless networking. Wireless networks are being used everywhere, and it is a network administrator’s job to ensure that the addition of a wireless network meets the connectivity, data throughput, and security requirements for the network.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This chapter addresses the basic issues of incorporating WLAN technologies into a network. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec2">Section 4-2</a>, “<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec2">The IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Standard</a>,” includes an overview of WLAN concepts and terminology, frequency allocations, and spread spectrum communication. The applications of WLANs are presented in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec3">Section 4-3</a>, “<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec3">802.11 Wireless Networking</a>,” which looks at various types of WLAN configurations, such as point-to-point and point-to-multipoint. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec4">Section 4-4</a>, “<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec4">Bluetooth, WiMAX, RFID, and Mobile Communications</a>,” looks at wireless networking technologies such as Bluetooth, WiMAX, and RFID. Any time a signal is transmitted over the air or even through a cable, there is some chance that the signal can be intercepted. Transmitting data over a wireless network introduces unique security issues. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec5">Section 4-5</a>, “<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec5">Configuring a Point-to-Multipoint Wireless LAN: A Case Study</a>,” presents an example of configuring a WLAN to provide access for users in a metropolitan area. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec6">Section 4-6</a> “<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec6">Troubleshooting Wireless Networks</a>” provides an overview of common techniques for troubleshooting wireless networks.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04tab01">Table 4-1</a> outlines the CompTIA Network+ objectives related to this chapter and identifies the chapter section that covers each objective. At the end of each chapter section you will find a review with comments on the Network+ objectives presented in that section. These comments are provided to help reinforce your understanding of each Network+ objective. The chapter review also includes “Test Your Knowledge” questions to help you understand key concepts before you advance to the next section of the chapter. At the end of the chapter you will find a complete set of questions as well as sample certification exam-type questions.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch4lev1sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175"></span><span class="space">4-2</span> The IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Standard</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A typical computer network uses twisted-pair and fiber-optic cable to interconnect LANs. Another media option competing for use in higher-data-rate LANs is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176"></span>wireless, based on the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard. The advantages of wireless include the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">It is cost-effective for use in areas that are difficult or too costly to wire.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">It enables user mobility in the workplace.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Wireless networks have become the network of choice in environments such as homes, small offices, and public places. Being able to connect to a network without a wire is convenient for users, and the cost is relatively low. In the age of laptops and mobile devices, wireless opens the door to user mobility in the workplace, and user mobility provides flexibility. Workers can potentially access the network or wireless data services from virtually any location within the workplace. Accessing information from the network is as easy as if the information were on a USB drive.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The benefits of wireless networks in the workplace are numerous. To provide wireless connectivity, a network administrator must be sure the network services are reliable and secure. In order to provide reliable network services, an administrator must have a good understanding of WLAN configurations and technologies. This and the following sections examine the fundamentals of wireless networking, the 802.11 standard and its family (802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax), and how WLANs are configured.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard defines the physical (PHY) layer, the media access control (MAC) layer, and the MAC management protocols and services.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The PHY layer defines the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">The method of transmitting the data, which can be either RF or infrared (although infrared is rarely used)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">How it interfaces with the MAC layer</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">The reliability of the data service</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">If data is being sent from PC-A to PC-D in the network shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig02">Figure 4-2</a>, the data is first sent to the access point and then relayed to PC-D. Data sent from a wireless client to a client in the wired LAN also passes through the access point. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178"></span>The users (clients) in the wireless LAN can communicate with other members of the network as long as a link is established with the access point.

        <p class="noindent">The problem with a basic service set is that mobile users can travel outside the radio range of a station’s wireless link if there is only one access point. One solution is to add multiple access points to the network. Multiple access points extend the range of mobility of a wireless client in the LAN. This arrangement is called an <a id="ch4key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo199"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>extended service set (ESS)</strong></span></a>. In the example of an ESS in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig03">Figure 4-3</a>, the mobile computer establishes an authorized connection with the access point that has the strongest signal level (for example, AP-1). As the user moves, the strength of the signal from AP-1 decreases. At some point, the signal strength from AP-2 exceeds that from AP-1, and the wireless bridge establishes a new connection with AP-2. This is called a <a id="ch4key7" href="glossary.xhtml#glo242"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>hand-off</strong></span></a>. The hand-off is an automatic process for the wireless client adapter in 802.11, and the term used to describe this is <a id="ch4key8" href="glossary.xhtml#glo508"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>roaming</strong></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Network access in 802.11 uses a technique called carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In <a id="ch4key9" href="glossary.xhtml#glo130"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>CSMA/CA</strong></span></a>, the client station listens for other users of the wireless network. If the channel is quiet (that is, no data transmission is occurring), the client station can transmit. If the channel is busy, the station(s) must wait until transmission stops. Each client station uses a unique random back-off time. This technique prevents client stations from trying to gain access to the wireless channel as soon as it becomes quiet. Currently four physical layer technologies are being used in 802.11 wireless networking: direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), infrared, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). DSSS is used in 802.11b/g/n wireless networks, and OFDM is used in 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax.</p>

        <p class="noindent">LANs emit significant RF noise in the 2.4GHz range that can affect wireless data. A significant improvement in wireless performance is available with the IEEE 802.11a standards. The 802.11a equipment operates in the 5GHz range and provides significant improvement over 802.11b with respect to RF interference. An important concept related to noise is signal-to-noise ratio, which is a measure of the signal level relative to the noise level. The value is usually expressed in decibels (dB), and a high dB value is desirable.</p>

        <p class="noindent">IEEE 802.11a equipment is not compatible with 802.11b or 802.11g. The upside of this is that 802.11a equipment does not interfere with 802.11b or g; therefore, 802.11a and 802.11b/g links can run next to each other without causing interference. 802.11n can operate either in the 2.4GHz range or the 5GHz range. Cheaper 802.11n wireless cards tend to be manufactured with only 2.4GHz antennas, so users have to check the frequency specifications as not all 802.11n equipment has both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig05">Figure 4-5</a> shows an example of the two links operating together. Along the same lines, frequency mismatch is an issue if the two ends of the communications link are operating on different channels or if you are trying to make 802.11a communicate with 802.11b, as the frequencies are not compatible.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The downsides of 802.11a are the increased cost of the equipment and increased power consumption because of the OFDM technology. This is of particular concern with mobile users because of the effect it can have on battery life. However, the maximum usable distance (RF range) for 802.11a is about the same as or even greater than that of 802.11b/g/n/ac/ax. It is important to note that any RF signal has distance limitations either due to limited output transmitted power, antenna pattern, or terrain issues.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182"></span>Another IEEE 802.11 wireless standard is IEEE 802.11g. The 802.11g standard supports the higher data transmission rates of 54Mbps but operates in the same 2.4GHz range as 802.11b. The 802.11g equipment is also backward compatible with 802.11b equipment. This means that 802.11b wireless clients can communicate with the 802.11g access points, and the 802.11g wireless client equipment can communicate with the 802.11b access points. The obvious advantage of this is that a company with an existing 802.11b wireless network can migrate to the higher data rates provided by 802.11g without having to sacrifice network compatibility. In fact, new wireless equipment supports both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz standards, and it therefore has the flexibility of high speed, compatibility, and noninterference.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Another entry into wireless networks is 802.11n. This wireless technology operates in the same ISM frequency as 802.11b/g (2.4GHz) and can also operate in the 5GHz band. A significant improvement with 802.11n is multiple-input multiple-output (<a id="ch4key17" href="glossary.xhtml#glo360"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MIMO</strong></span></a>). MIMO uses a technique called space-division multiplexing, in which the data stream is split into multiple parts called spatial streams. The different spatial streams are transmitted using separate antennas. With MIMO, doubling the spatial streams doubles the effective data rate. The downside of this is the possibility of increased power consumption. The 802.11n specification includes a MIMO power-save mode. With this mode, 802.11n uses multiple data paths only when faster data transmission is required—thus saving power.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The 802.11ac technology operates in the 5GHz band. It uses a newer version of MIMO technology with eight spatial streams and has channels up to 80MHz wide. It also introduces multiuser MIMO (<a id="ch4key18" href="glossary.xhtml#glo388"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MU-MIMO</strong></span></a>), which can send MIMO spatial streams to multiple clients at the same time. 802.11ac incorporates standardized <a id="ch4key19" href="glossary.xhtml#glo60"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>beamforming</strong></span></a>, a technique that is used to direct transmission of the radio signal to a specific device. Beamforming increases data throughput and reduces power consumption. 802.11n used beamforming, but it was not standardized. The transmit range for 802.11ac is similar to or better than that of 802.11n.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The latest addition to the 802.11 family is 802.11ax, also known as Wi-Fi 6. Whereas 802.11ac operates in the 5GHz band only, 802.11ax operates in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. 802.11ax uses OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) rather than OFDM. OFDMA allows multiple users or clients to share the same channel simultaneously. Wireless devices can optionally support WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3), but 802.11ax increases security requirements by mandating the use of WPA3 as its encryption and authentication standard. WPA3 is discussed in more detail in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Network Security</a>.”</p>

        <p class="noindent">A wireless LAN can be configured in many ways to meet the needs of an organization. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig06">Figure 4-6</a> provides an example of a basic 802.11b/g/n/ac/ax WLAN configuration. In this configuration, each PC is outfitted with a wireless LAN adapter card. Today, most computer desktops and especially computer laptops are equipped with wireless adapters. For devices that lack these cards, an external USB wireless adapter can be used. A wireless adapter (or wireless LAN adapter) is a device that connects a client to the wireless medium, which is typically a radio wave channel in the 2.4GHz or 5GHz ISM band. The wireless medium can also be infrared, although that is not used very often. The following services are provided by a wireless LAN adapter:</p>

        <p class="noindent">One of the biggest misconceptions about wireless is that it does not require a wired connection. This is not quite correct. The connection to a wired LAN is provided by a wireless access point (WAP), which provides a bridge between the wireless LAN and the wired network. A physical cable connection (typically CAT6 or higher) ties the access point to the wired network’s switch or hub (typically Ethernet).</p>
        <p class="noindent">For example, computer PC-A in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig06">Figure 4-6</a> sends a data packet to PC-D, a destination in the wired LAN. PC-A first sends a data packet over the wireless link. The access point recognizes the sender of the data packet as a host in wireless LAN-X and allows the wireless data to enter the access point. At this time, the data is sent out the physical Ethernet connection to the wired LAN. The data packet is then delivered to PC-D in the wired LAN.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">SSID</p>
        <p class="box-para">Service set identifier, a password that enables the client to join the wireless network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">How does the access point know that the wireless data packet is being sent from a client in the wireless LAN? The 802.11 wireless LAN devices use an <a id="ch4key21" href="glossary.xhtml#glo539"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SSID</strong></span></a> to identify what wireless data traffic is allowed to connect to the network. The SSID is the wireless <em>service set identifier</em>, which enables the client to join the wireless network.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The access point uses the SSID to determine whether the client is to become a member of the wireless network. The term <em>association</em> is used to describe a wireless connection that is made. The wrong SSID prevents an association, keeping the client from being able to become a member of the wireless network.</p>
        <p class="noindent">People are commonly surprised by the fact that an access point has two antennas. The two antennas implement <em>spatial diversity</em>, improving received signal gain and performance.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187"></span><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig07">Figure 4-7</a> provides an example of the information displayed on the wireless adapter’s console port when an association is made. The text indicates that a connection has been made to a parent (access point) whose MAC address is 00-40-96-25-9d-14. The text indicates that this MAC address has been added to the list of associations. This type of information is typically available via the wireless management software that comes with the wireless PC or PCMCIA adapter.</p>

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">An access point uses an association to build a table of users (clients) on the wireless network; this association table lists the MAC addresses for each networking device connected to the wireless network. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig08">Figure 4-8</a> provides an example of an association table. The access point uses the association table to forward data packets between the access point and the wireless network. As shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig08">Figure 4-8</a>, the wireless client adapter also notifies the user if the client has lost an association with the access point.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A wireless bridge is a popular choice for connecting LANs that are running similar network protocols, even if the LANs are miles apart. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig09">Figure 4-9</a> provides examples. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig09">Figure 4-9</a>(a) shows a point-to-point wireless bridge. Each building shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig09">Figure 4-9</a>(a) has a connection from the wireless bridge to the building’s LAN, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig10">Figure 4-10</a>. The wireless bridge then connects to an antenna placed on the roof. A clear (line-of-sight) transmission path must exist between the two buildings; otherwise, signal <em>attenuation</em> (loss) or signal disruption can result. Antenna selection is also critical when configuring the connection. (This issue is addressed in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4lev1sec5">Section 4-5</a>.) The antenna must be selected so that the signal strength at the receiving site is sufficient to meet the required received signal level.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_189"></span><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig09">Figure 4-9</a>(b) shows how a wireless bridge can be used to connect multiple remote sites to the main transmitting facility. Each building uses a bridge setup similar to that shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig10">Figure 4-10</a>. The bridge connects to its respective LAN. In this case, Bld-A uses an antenna that has a wide coverage area (radiation pattern). The key objective with antenna selection is that the antenna must provide coverage for all receiving sites (in this case, Bld-B and Bld-C).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Wireless controllers are commonly used in enterprise wireless environments when managing hundreds of APs or more. In a traditional stand-alone wireless environment, each AP is managed individually. In an enterprise wireless controller environment, an AP communicates with its controller when booting up to download its necessary firmware and software, to register and authenticate itself, to receive its network information settings, and to receive its wireless LAN (WLAN) configuration. The wireless controller becomes the brain and manager of the whole operation. When wireless changes need to be made, they can be made at the controller, which pushes the changes out to all of the APs. CAPWAP (Configuration and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is the underlying wireless control protocol that APs use to communicate with wireless controllers. It supersedes LWAPP (Lightweight Access Point Protocol), which is a Cisco-proprietary protocol.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Wireless capacity is an issue today with the ever-increasing number of wireless users. Device density is the number of connecting wireless clients, and it has to be considered. Every wireless access point has a maximum device density that it can handle at one time. From a system design perspective, you have to plan for potential overcapacity with high-density Wi-Fi hotspots that can accommodate video streaming, image downloads, and multiple clients. Make sure you select access points than can handle the bandwidth demand; you don’t want your clients to have to sacrifice bandwidth, especially when a cell phone can be set up as a hotspot that a wireless device can use to connect to the Internet via the data plan.</p>
        <p class="noindent">With wireless LANs, there is a maximum distance the signal can be transmitted. The distance limitation is a critical issue inside buildings when user mobility is required. Many obstacles can reflect and attenuate signals, causing reception to suffer. Also, the signal level for mobile users is hampered by increased distance from the access point. Distance is also a critical issue in outdoor point-to-multipoint wireless networks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A solution is to place multiple wireless access points within the facility, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig11">Figure 4-11</a>. Mobile clients can maintain a connection as they travel through the workplace because the wireless client automatically selects the access point that provides the strongest signal level. The access points can be arranged so that overlapping coverage of the workplace is provided, thus enabling seamless roaming for the client. The signal coverage is shown as circles in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig11">Figure 4-11</a>. In actual practice, the radiation patterns are highly irregular due to reflections of the transmitted signal.</p>
        <p class="noindent">To have good wireless coverage in a large environment, it is not unusual to see the number of wireless access points in the range of hundreds or thousands. When dealing with so many wireless access points, it is very difficult and inefficient to program and manage each WAP individually and manually. Typically, a wireless LAN controller (WLC) is used as a central point or controller to deploy and manage all WAPs on a wireless network. When connecting to the network, each WAP connects to its WLC to get its configuration, radio channel, transmission power, and other settings. The WAPs communicate with the WLC and send their operational <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_190"></span>wireless information to the WLC. The WLC can then use the collective information from all its WAPs to automatically adjust settings such as user load, radio channels, and radio power to improve the performance of the wireless network.</p>

The site survey begins with placing an access point at position 1. A wireless mobile client is used to check the signal throughout the building. This checking used to be performed by a laptop with a purpose-built WLAN adapter as a Wi-Fi analyzer, but today, many more options are available. Handheld devices, such as tablets and smartphones, can be conveniently used for wireless site surveys. Their form factor and mobility are perfect for this purpose. Most of these devices are already equipped with built-in wireless chips. All they need is one of the many available wireless apps. This example shows test results gathered from an Android tablet with a free Wi-Fi analyzer app installed.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig13">Figure 4-13</a> shows a snapshot of the wireless environment in the area. The graph shows the signal strength for each wireless SSID found. The signal strength is the wireless signal power level, and it is represented in –dBm format, from 0 to –100. This is the power ratio, in dB, of the measured power referenced to 1 mW. The closer the value is to 0, the stronger the signal, and the stronger the signal, the more reliable the wireless connection. Wireless is everywhere today, so when you conduct a site survey, you should not be too surprised to see more SSIDs than just yours. For this example, the site survey is intended for the wireless SSID ET377. As the graph shows, ET377 has the strongest signal of all the SSIDs. However, the signal strength may not represent the goodput. <em>Goodput</em> refers to the actual wireless data throughput, as measured by an application on the end device. It represents the actual transmission rate of a wireless connection, which is not the maximum theoretical transmission rate.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section looks at four wireless technologies: Bluetooth, WiMAX, RFID, and mobile communications. Each of these technologies plays an important role in wireless networks. The sections that follow examine each of these wireless technologies, including a look at configuration and examples of the hardware being used.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec5">Bluetooth</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The wireless technology Bluetooth is based on the 802.15 standard. Bluetooth was developed to replace the cable connecting computers, mobile phones, handheld devices, portable computers, and fixed electronic devices. The information normally carried by a cable is transmitted over the 2.4GHz ISM frequency band, which is the same frequency band used by 802.11b/g/n/ax. There are four output power classes for Bluetooth. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04tab06">Table 4-6</a> lists the maximum output power and the operating distance for each class.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology has been developed to provide operation on a small battery for up to five years. This technology is ideal for applications that require the exchange of small amounts of data periodically. BLE operates in the 2.4GHz ISM band and remains in sleep mode except when a connection is initiated. BLE devices have significantly lower power requirements than do traditional Wi-Fi devices. For example, whereas a Wi-Fi device consumes about 500 μW for 10 messages, a BLE device consumes only 50 μW.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch4key28" href="glossary.xhtml#glo682"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>WiMAX</strong></span></a> (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a broadband wireless system that has been developed for broadband wireless access (<a id="ch4key29" href="glossary.xhtml#glo77"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>BWA</strong></span></a>) for fixed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200"></span>and mobile stations and can provide a wireless alternative for last-mile broadband access in the 2GHz–66GHz frequency range. BWA access for fixed stations can be up to 30 miles, whereas mobile BWA access is 3–10 miles. Internationally, the WiMAX frequency standard is 3.5GHz, while the United States uses both the unlicensed 5.8GHz and the licensed 2.5GHz spectra. In addition, WiMAX has been investigationally adapted for use in the 700MHz frequency range. Information transmitted at this frequency is less susceptible to signal blockage due to trees. The disadvantage of the lower frequency range is the reduction in bandwidth.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">WiMAX uses OFDM as its signaling format. This signaling format was selected for the WiMAX IEEE 802.16a standard because of its improved <a id="ch4key30" href="glossary.xhtml#glo408"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>NLOS</strong></span></a> (non-line-of-sight) characteristics in the 2GHz–11GHz frequency range. An OFDM system uses multiple frequencies for transporting the data, which helps minimize multipath interference problems. Some frequencies may experience interference problems, but the system can select the best frequencies for transporting the data.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">NLOS</p>
        <p class="box-para">Non-line-of-sight</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">WiMAX also provides flexible channel sizes (for example, 3.5MHz, 5MHz, and 10MHz), which provides adaptability to standards for WiMAX worldwide. This also helps ensure that the maximum data transfer rate is supported. For example, the allocated channel bandwidth could be 6MHz, and the adaptability of the WiMAX channel size enables it to adjust to use the entire allocated bandwidth.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In addition, the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) media access control (MAC) layer differs from the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi MAC layer in that the WiMAX system has to compete only once to gain entry into the network. When a WiMAX unit has gained access, the base station allocates a time slot to it, thereby providing the WiMAX system scheduled access to the network. The WiMAX system uses time-division multiplexing (TDM) data streams on the downlink and time-division multiple access (TDMA) on the uplink and centralized channel management to ensure that time-sensitive data is delivered on time. In addition, WiMAX operates in a collision-free environment, which improves channel throughput.</p>

        <p class="box-para">The last part of the connection from a telecommunications provider to a customer</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">WiMAX has a range of up to 30 miles, and it operates in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint configurations. This can be useful in situations where DSL or cable network connectivity is not available. WiMAX is also useful for providing the last-mile connection. The <a id="ch4key31" href="glossary.xhtml#glo317"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>last mile</strong></span></a> is basically the last part of the connection from a telecommunications provider to a customer. The cost of the last mile connection can be high, which makes a wireless alternative attractive to customers.</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The reader transmits radio waves, which activates (turns on) an RFID tag. The tag then transmits modulated data, containing its unique identification information stored in the tag, back to the reader. The reader then extracts the data stored on the RFID tag.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The RFID idea dates back to 1948, when the concept of using reflected power as a means of communication was first proposed. The 1970s saw further development in RFID technology—in particular, a UHF scheme that incorporates rectification of the RF signal for providing power to the tag. Development of RFID technology significantly increased in the 1990s. Applications included toll collection that allowed vehicles to pass through tollbooths at highway speeds while still being able to record data from the tag.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Today, RFID technology is being used to track inventory shipments for major commercial retailers, by the transportation industry, and by the Department of Defense. In addition, RFID applications are being used in Homeland Security for tracking container shipments at border crossings. In addition, RFID is being incorporated into WLAN computer networks to keep better track of inventory. RFID technology is being used as a wireless means of asset tracking and is therefore becoming more important in networks. The tracking technology is even being extended to tracking Wi-Fi devices within the WLAN infrastructure.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Three parameters define an RFID system:</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Powering the Tag</h5>
        <p class="noindent">RFID tags are classified in three ways, based on how they obtain their operating power:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Passive:</strong> Power is provided to a passive tag by rectifying the RF energy, transmitted from the reader, that strikes the RF tag antenna. The rectified power level is sufficient to power the ICs on the tags and also provides <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202"></span>sufficient power for the tag to transmit a signal back to the reader. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig22">Figure 4-22</a> shows an example of a passive RFID tag (also called an inlay). A tag inlay includes both an RFID chip and an antenna mounted on a substrate.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Semi-active:</strong> With semi-active tags, a battery powers the electronics on a tag, but the tag uses backscatter to transmit information back to the reader.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Active:</strong> With active tags, a battery powers the tag and transmits a signal back to the reader. Basically, this is a radio transmitter. New active RFID tags are incorporating wireless Ethernet (that is, 802.11 Wi-Fi connectivity). An example is the G2C501 active RFID tag from G2 Microsystems, shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig23">Figure 4-23</a>. The power consumption of the G2C501 is 10 μA in sleep mode, and the device uses two AA batteries with an expected lifetime of five years. The G2C501 also works in the standard 915MHz range. In addition, the G2C501 has location capability. This is accomplished by making receive signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from three separate access points. The three measurements provide sufficient information to make a triangulation measurement for use in locating the object.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Frequency of Operation</h5>
        <p class="noindent">RFID tags must be tuned to the reader’s transmit frequency in order to turn on. RFID systems typically use three frequency bands for operation (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig24">Figure 4-24</a>):</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Low frequency (LF):</strong> LF tags typically use frequency-shift keying (FSK) between the 125KHz and 134KHz frequencies. These tags can handle only low data rates (~12Kbps), and they are not appropriate for any applications requiring fast data transfers. However, LF tags are suitable for animal identification, such as with dairy cattle and other livestock. The RFID tag information is typically obtained when the livestock are being fed. The read range for low-frequency tags is approximately 0.33 meter.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>High frequency (HF):</strong> HF tags operate in the 13.56MHz industrial band. High-frequency tags have been available commercially since 1995. The longer wavelengths of the HF radio signal are less susceptible to absorption by water or other liquids. Therefore, these tags are suitable for tagging liquids. The read range for HF tags is approximately 1 meter. The short read range provides for better-defined read ranges. The applications for tags in this frequency range include access control, smart cards, and shelf inventory. The data rate for HF tags is 26Kbps.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Ultra-high frequency (UHF):</strong> UHF tags work at 860–960MHz and at 2.4GHz. The data rates for these tags can be 50–150Kbps and greater. These tags are popular for tracking inventory. The read range for passive UHF tags is 3–6 meters, which makes them a good choice for reading pallet tags. However, if an active tag is used, a read range up to 100 meters is possible.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Communications (Air Interface) Protocol</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The air interface protocol adopted for RFID tags is <a id="ch4key34" href="glossary.xhtml#glo559"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Slotted Aloha</strong></span></a>, a network communications protocol similar to the Ethernet protocol. With Slotted Aloha, the tags are only allowed to transmit at predetermined times after being energized. This technique reduces the likelihood of data collisions between RFID tag transmissions and allows for the reading of up to 1000 tags per second (for high-frequency tags). The operating range for RFID tags can be up to 30 meters. This means that multiple tags can be energized at the same time, and RF data collisions can possibly occur. If a collision occurs, the tag will transmit again after a random back-off time. The readers transmit continuously until there is no tag collision.</p>

        <p class="noindent">CDMA (code-division multiple access) is a communications technology in which spread-spectrum techniques are used to multiplex more than one signal within a single channel. In this case, each device uses a different binary sequence to modulate the carrier, spreading the spectrum of the waveform (spread spectrum). The signals are separated at the receiver by a correlator that accepts only the signal from the selected binary sequence.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The cost of installing a wired connection back to the home network would be too high, so it is decided to use a point-to-point 802.11 wireless link for the interconnection. This requires that antennas be placed at both the home network and the antenna site. A wireless bridge is used at each end of the point-to-point wireless link to interconnect the networks. The bridge will connect to the wired home network and to the multipoint distribution on the antenna site. Also, each antenna will be outfitted with lightning arrestors to protect the electronics from any possible lightning strikes. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig26">Figure 4-26</a> shows the proposed wireless connection.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec13">Steps 3 and 4: Configuring the Multipoint Distribution and Conducting an RF Site Survey</h4>
        <p class="noindent">At this point, a wireless data link has been established with the home network. The next task is to configure the antenna site for multipoint distribution. It was previously decided that a 300Mbps link would be adequate for the remote users, based on the data rate to be supported for the planned coverage area.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The site survey in step 1 showed that there is a clear view of the surrounding area for 6 kilometers in each direction. Antenna A (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04tab07">Table 4-7</a>) provides an omnidirectional radiation pattern for 7 kilometers. This satisfies the coverage area. Antenna A is mounted on the antenna site tower, connected to a lightning arrestor, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210"></span>and then connected to the output of a wireless bridge. Next, an RF site survey of the planned coverage area is conducted to verify the signal quality provided by the antenna selected. Measurements are made from multiple locations in the planned coverage area. All remote sites within 4 kilometers of the distribution show excellent signal strength (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig28">Figure 4-28</a>).</p>
        <p class="noindent">The signal quality drops to good at 6 kilometers at all surveyed remote locations except for one area, which shows a poor quality (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig29">Figure 4-29</a>). The signal is apparently being affected by multipath distortion from a small lake area. A fix to this might be to move the antenna to a different height to minimize reflection problems. An antenna at a different height will receive different reflections and possibly less interference. In some cases, antenna alignment can be changed to decrease the interference. A more costly solution would be to add antenna diversity, which basically means placing multiple antennas on the receiving tower and using the best signal for the connection.</p>
        <div class="note">
        <p class="note-t">Note</p>
        <p class="note-para">When dealing with antennas, it is important to consider effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), which is the power that comes off an antenna and is the value the FCC uses to determine and measure power limits in wireless equipment.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section examines some common techniques for troubleshooting wireless networks. Wireless networks have greatly simplified the steps for connecting to a network, but they do occasionally fail. The following sections describe some scenarios that users might encounter and steps for troubleshooting and resolving the wireless issues.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec17">Access Point Hardware Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The primary hardware device in wireless networks is the access point. Some networks have multiple access points. A simple first step is to ping the IP address for an access point in order to verify network connectivity. You should expect a reply to the ping, but if you don’t get a reply, you can verify the IP address and repeat the ping. If it still doesn’t work, there is a good chance there is a problem with the access point. Try unplugging the access point and plugging it back in to reset the access point. Try the ping again, and if it still doesn’t work, the access point might have a problem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec18">Wireless Router Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Make sure the client and wireless router support the same Wi-Fi version. For example, if a client computer’s Wi-Fi card supports only 802.11b, the wireless router must also support 802.11b or must be configured to run in a mixed mode, with multiple protocols supported.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Also, in the case where multiple clients are connecting to the wireless router, it is important to understand that when an association is made between the client and the wireless router, the client with the lowest 802.11 system will set the clock speed. For example, say that a client running 802.11b and another running 802.11g connect to the same wireless router. The data transfer rate for 802.11b is 11Mbps, and the rate for 802.11g is 54Mbps. The wireless router will select 802.11b’s lower clock rate for all associations. This can be of some concern to clients that have the capability to connect at a higher data transfer rate.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec19">Wireless Compatibility</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Not all wireless clients are created equal, and wireless clients depend on their hardware and software, which they must keep up to date. Also, in order to have reliable and good wireless connectivity, the wireless access point and the wireless clients must be compatible and use the same standard.</p>
        <p class="noindent">802.11n is a standard that can offer connectivity in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz or both. This means a wireless client can be 802.11n compatible just by operating in one frequency, not both. Therefore, an 802.11n wireless client with only a 2.4GHz radio will never achieve the high speed of 300Mbps offered by 5GHz. When troubleshooting the RF spectrum associated with a signal such as a Wi-Fi signal, a spectrum analyzer is typically used.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec20"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214"></span>Signal Strength Problems</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The purpose of measuring signal strength is to verify that you have good signal level at the receive location. Typically, the signal strength of a wireless connection can be adjusted at the access point to expand or reduce the area of coverage. Things change, and a loss in signal strength might not be a problem with the access point. It is possible that something could have been moved and is physically blocking the signal, thus causing RF attenuation. The RSSI (received signal strength indicator) value of a user should be monitored to identify signal strength issues.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec21">Wireless Coverage</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A wireless coverage area, or a cell, is very dependent on the RF transmission radiated from a wireless router or an access point. So, there is a limitation to the size of a cell for each access point. In a large geographic area, multiple wireless access points are deployed to create multiple cells in an attempt to give enough total coverage area. Good coverage depends on cells overlapping. Failure of cells to overlap introduces weak or dead wireless spots, thus creating insufficient wireless coverage. Also, bad coverage negatively affects client roaming. When a wireless client moves from one cell to another, it must establish an association with the new access point. With bad coverage, the AP association time increases, in turn causing delay or interruption.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec22">Extending the Wireless Range</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Another way to improve wireless coverage is to extend the wireless range. The following are general tips for extending the wireless range:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">Make sure the antenna is placed high and is not obstructed by any metal. It is important to remember that radio waves reflect off metal surfaces. Also, surfaces such as concrete and brick attenuate the signal.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">In some cases, you might have to use a high-gain antenna to help boost the receive signal strength.</p></li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec23">Frequency Interference Problems</h4>
        <p class="noindent">An electrical device such as a microwave oven may cause interference. Microwave ovens operate at the 2.4GHz frequency, which is the same band in which 802.11b/g/n devices operate. It is good to have a baseline measurement of the signal strength expected at each location in order to better identify interference. A good indicator of interference is the signal-to-noise RATIO (SNR).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec24">Wireless Channel Utilization</h4>
        <p class="noindent">For the 2.4GHz wireless frequency, the default channel for 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n wireless routers is channel 6. If you have interference problems, there may be a wireless router nearby with an SSID using the same channel. In such a case, you can change the channel to 1 or 11 so that the RF spectra on these channels do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215"></span>not overlap (refer to <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig04">Figure 4-4</a>). 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n wireless routers have 11 possible channels, and you can select an alternate channel via the wireless router’s settings. Changing to a different channel will reduce the SNR, which is likely to solve your problem. Even though 5GHz wireless has more channels, the same concept applies for 802.11a, 802.11n (5GHz), 802.11ac, and 802.11ax.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec25">Load Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Wireless users share the same frequency channel to communicate to the same access point. If too many users connect to the same access point at the same time, they start experiencing slowness and packet drops due to overcapacity. For optimum load capacity, consult the documentation of the access point manufacturer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec26">SSID Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Once the SSID has been configured for a computer, it normally does not require reconfiguration. However, while traveling, you might reconfigure the SSID to connect to a different network. Also, when manually configuring an incorrect SSID or settings, human-error mistakes can be made. The simple fix is to reset the SSID when you return to your home network.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec27">Securing Wi-Fi Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Any time you are connecting a wireless device to a public hotspot, there is a chance that someone using a packet sniffer will be able to see your data traffic. You can avoid possible problems by enabling WPA to secure your data traffic. Most wireless systems support multiple network security protocols (for example, different versions of WPA3, WPA2, WPA, or WEP). Make sure the client and access point are running the same security mode. Otherwise, an encryption protocol mismatch will occur, resulting in no wireless connection.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec28">Cable Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Even when you are focusing on troubleshooting wireless issues, a problem could be due to a simple physical cable connection. A cable could be loose, may have become disconnected, or may be bad. It is always good to have a spare cable just in case. Remember that you can always verify that you have a connection by checking for the presence of a link light. Also, bad cables create attenuation and introduce loss of signal. Attenuation in any type of cable connecting to the access point—such as antenna cable attenuation, fiber cable attenuation, or Ethernet cable attenuation—could introduce signal issues into the wireless connection.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec29">Deauthentication/Disassociation Attacks</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Deauthentication and disassociation are legitimate handshakes used by a wireless client when leaving a wireless network. However, a denial of service (DOS) attack that exploits deauthentication and disassociation creates client disassociation issues. By spoofing a disassociate or deauthenticate message while pretending to be a targeted wireless client, the access point disassociates the targeted wireless client from the wireless network.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec30"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216"></span>DHCP Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Wireless devices require valid IP addresses. Access points typically assign a 192.168.0.<em>x</em> address to the client. You can verify the IP address assigned by entering the command <strong>ipconfig</strong> at the command prompt (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec4">Section 1-4</a>, “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec4">The Ethernet LAN</a>,” in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a>, “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Introduction to Computer Networks</a>”).</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch4lev2sec31">Wireless Printer Issues</h4>
        <p class="noindent">If you are experiencing problems with a wireless printer that was recently working, the first step is to restart the printer, your computer, and your wireless router. If this doesn’t fix the problem, you can print the network configuration from the printer. Check the IP address for the printer and verify that it is assigned an IP address in your network. You can check the IP address of your computer by issuing the command <strong>ipconfig</strong> from the command prompt (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec4">Section 1-4</a> in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch4lev1sec7"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217"></span>Summary</h3>
        <p class="noindent">This chapter presents an overview of wireless networking, including fundamental concepts and sample networks. The vendors of wireless networking equipment have made their devices easy to integrate into existing networks, but you must understand that the key objective of a network administrator is to provide a fast, reliable, and secure computer network. Carelessly integrating wireless components into a network can easily compromise this objective.</p>
        <p class="noindent">You should understand the following from reading this chapter:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">The operating characteristics of the 802.11 wireless networks</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">The purposes of access points, wireless LAN adapters, and wireless bridges</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">How to perform a basic site survey on a building</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">How to configure a network for user mobility</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">How to plan multipoint wireless distribution</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Wireless networking technologies have greatly simplified planning and installation. However, they have also brought some complications. For example, any time you are working with RF, there is a chance of unexpected interference and noise. A well-planned RF installation requires a study of all known interference and a search for any possible interference. An RF study should also include signal path studies that enable the user to prepare a well-thought-out plan and allow an excellent prediction of received signal level. The bottom line is to obtain support for conducting an RF study.</p>
