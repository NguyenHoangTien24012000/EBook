        <p class="noindent">This chapter examines the twisted-pair media used to link computers together to form a local area network (LAN). This media is called <a id="ch2key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo458"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>physical layer cabling</strong></span></a>. The term <em>physical layer</em> describes the media interconnecting networking devices. In this chapter you will gain an introductory understanding of the cable media, including the category types, the steps for terminating cables, cable testing, certification, and troubleshooting. The main focus is on the use of UTP cable in computer networks, although an overview of shielded twisted-pair (STP) is presented as well. (Fiber-optic cable, which also plays an important role in modern computer networks, is thoroughly examined in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>, “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3">Physical Layer Cabling: Fiber Optics</a>.”) A network technician or engineer needs to have a good understanding of how physical layer cable is being used and its specific application.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Other types of cabling you might encounter in computer networking are RG-6 and possibly RG-59. These types of cables, called <em>coaxial cables</em>, are primarily used to connect satellite systems or cable television and modems. Cable terminations for these types of cable include F-type and BNC connector types. Another type of coax cable is called twinaxial. This is a type of coaxial cable that contains two inner conductors rather than one.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following are some of the connector types used with physical layer cabling:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>UTP coupler:</strong> This small device, which is used to connect two UTP cables, is also called an <em>inline coupler</em>. UTP couplers can be used to couple twisted-pair cabling and RJ-11 phone lines but can introduce signal degradation.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>BNC connectors:</strong> BNC stands for Bayonet Neill–Concelman. This type of connector is a quick-connect connector for coaxial cable that was commonly used with thinnet Ethernet cabling.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Fiber coupler:</strong> These couplers come in a variety of styles that support single-mode and multimode fibers. These devices allow a single fiber to be split into two outputs, and multiple input fibers can be combined into one output fiber.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>APC and UPC:</strong> The difference between these two types of connectors is the fiber endface. An <a id="ch2key2" href="glossary.xhtml#glo31"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>angled physical contact (APC)</strong></span></a> endface is polished and has an 8-degree angle. An <a id="ch2key3" href="glossary.xhtml#glo653"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ultra-physical contact (UPC)</strong></span></a> endface is polished and has no angle. APC and UPC connectors are easily identified by their color: APC adapters are green, and UPC adapters are blue.</p>

        <p class="box-title">Angled Physical Contact (APC)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A green fiber connector whose endface is polished and has an 8-degree angle</p>

        </div></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65"></span><strong>Fiber-to-coaxial connector:</strong> This device is used to convert an optical signal carried over fiber to an electrical signal carried over coaxial cable. A typical application for this type of connector is coupling cabling that carries digital optical signal to a digital coaxial cable.</p></li>

        <section>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch2lev1sec1"><span class="space">2-1</span> Introduction</h3>
        <p class="noindent">This chapter begins with an overview of structured cabling. This section defines the six subsystems of a structured cabling system and focuses on the basic issues associated with horizontal cabling or wiring a LAN. Next, the basic operational characteristics of UTP cable are examined. The discussion includes an examination of the various categories of UTP cable currently available. Following that is an overview of constructing twisted-pair patch and horizontal link cabling. This chapter discusses the tools and techniques for properly terminating UTP cabling for twisted-pair Ethernet such as CAT5e, CAT6, CAT6a, CAT7, and CAT8. It also provides an introduction to testing and certifying Ethernet cables. This chapter includes several examples of cable test data and how to interpret the test results. The chapter concludes with a section on troubleshooting computer networks, with a focus on cable or physical failures.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02tab01">Table 2-1</a> outlines the CompTIA Network+ objectives related to this chapter and identifies the chapter section that covers each objective. At the end of each chapter section you will find a review with comments on the Network+ objectives presented in that section. These comments are provided to help reinforce your understanding of each Network+ objective. The chapter review also includes “Test Your Knowledge” questions to help you understand key concepts before you advance to the next section of the chapter. At the end of the chapter you will find a complete set of questions as well as sample certification exam-type questions.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The first major standard describing a structured cabling system for computer networks was TIA/EIA 568-A, implemented in 1995. <a id="ch2key4" href="glossary.xhtml#glo178"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>EIA</strong></span></a> is the Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade organization that lobbies for the interests of manufacturers of electronics-related equipment. <a id="ch2key5" href="glossary.xhtml#glo624"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>TIA</strong></span></a> is the Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade organization that represents the interests of the telecommunications industry. The wiring standards for modern computer networks are defined by the TIA/EIA 568 standard. The most important addendum to the TIA/EIA 568-A standard is Addendum 5, published in 1999, which defines the transmission performance specifications for four-pair 100-ohm Category 5e twisted-pair cabling. TIA/EIA adopted Category 6 (CAT6) cable specifications in June 2002 as part of TIA/EIA 568-B. This is the type of cabling recommended for use in today’s computer networks. CAT6a was adopted in 2018 for 10Gbps speed. CAT7 and CAT8 twisted-pair cables are the latest additions but are not in wide use. The latest TIA/EIA standard is TIA/EIA 568-D.</p>

A campus network consists of interconnected LANs within a limited geographic area such as a college campus, military base, or group of commercial buildings.

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch2lev2sec1">Horizontal Cabling</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Permanent network cabling within a building is considered <em>horizontal cabling,</em> defined as cabling that extends out from the telecommunications closet into the LAN work area. It is important to take time to plan for a horizontal cabling installation because this is where users interface with the network. There is always a substantial installation cost associated with horizontal cabling, and there is even greater cost in having to replace or upgrade a cable installation. You don’t want to have to re-cable a system very often. Careful attention should be given to planning for the horizontal cabling of a LAN. It is important to make sure you fully understand your current networking needs and that your proposed plan meets the needs. You should also ensure that your plan addresses the future needs and growth of your network.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig03">Figure 2-3</a> illustrates the basic blocks of a horizontal cabling system from the telecommunications closet to the computer in the LAN. The figure shows the following components, which are typically found in the telecommunications closet:</p>
        <ol class="upper-alpha">
        <li><p class="alpha">Backbone cabling interconnecting this closet with other closets</p></li>

        <li><p class="alpha">Patch cable connecting the computer to the wall plate</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noindent">Item E in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig03">Figure 2-3</a> shows the cabling leaving the telecommunications closet. The cable extends to where it is terminated at the wall plate (item F) in the LAN or work area. The term <em>terminated</em> describes where the cable connects to a jack in a wall plate, a patch panel, or an RJ-45 modular plug. In this case, the cable terminates into an RJ-45 jack in the wall plate. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig04">Figure 2-4</a> shows an example of an RJ-45 wall plate and patch panel.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71"></span>A technique for troubleshooting cable termination is to use a toner probe. A toner probe injects a tone on a cable in a process called tone generation. You can use a speaker/sensor to verify that a tone is present at the other cable end. This technique is also very useful when you need to locate a cable end: The cable you are searching for transmits the tone.</p>

        <p class="noindent">An individual cable is used to connect each connector in an outlet to the patch panel in the telecommunications closet (item F to item E in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig03">Figure 2-3</a>). (<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2lev1sec4">Section 2-4</a>, “<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2lev1sec4">Terminating Twisted-Pair Cables</a>,” provides more information on RJ-45 plugs and jacks.) Another 8-pin connector that uses an 8P8C modular connector is the RJ-48. This type of connector, which is commonly used with T1 data lines, typically works with shielded twisted-pair cabling. Although the RJ-45 and RJ-48 connectors look similar, they do not use the same wiring scheme, and they are intended for different data transmission applications.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In a star topology, there is an individual cable run for each outlet in the wall plate. This means that you assign one computer to each terminated outlet. A <a id="ch2key23" href="glossary.xhtml#glo447"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>patch cable</strong></span></a> (item G) is used to make the physical connection from the computer to the wall plate, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig03">Figure 2-3</a>. There is a 100-meter overall length limitation on the cable run from the telecommunications closet to a networking device in the work area. This includes the length of the patch cables at each end (items D and G) plus the cable run (item E). A general rule of thumb is to allow 90 meters for the cable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72"></span>run from the telecommunications closet to the work area (item E). This allows 5 meters of cable length for the work area and 5 meters for the patch cables in the telecommunications closet (item D) and the work area (item G). <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig05">Figure 2-5</a> shows an example of the inside of a telecommunications closet.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Labeling is extremely important for all aspects of a computer network and data center. Each rack should be labeled to identify the purpose of the equipment installed in the rack (for example, telecommunication equipment that interfaces with the WAN connection). In addition, it is important to label each server to identify the purpose and possibly its name. Cabling should also be labeled. Both cable ends or wall plates should be labeled with some identifying marks that correspond to your building drawings. This type of labeling makes it possible for a technician to easily identify a cable and its path.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Two types of labeling are commonly used in networks:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Port labeling:</strong> When labeling your equipment and cabling, it is important to develop a standardized format that contains all the information you will need at a later time. Remember that your facility will eventually have a lot of equipment and cables, and being able to easily identify them will be of great benefit to the technical staff. Also make sure the labels correspond to your drawings.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>System labeling:</strong> System labels are important because they ensure that the technical staff are referencing the same system. A large facility will eventually have many systems doing similar tasks, and being able to identify the correct system will simplify your work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Creating proper <em>rack diagrams</em> is also an extremely important part of documentation and rack management for a system. Racks are used in a multitude of places in network systems. Racks could be installed in closets, or there could be many racks in a data center. You can also expect to have server rack frames with air blowing over the devices for cooling. Racks must be securely installed and grounded. Rack types vary for sites, but the most common are 19-inch rack frames. There also two-post racks used for smaller telecommunication equipment. Four-post racks are typically used for servers.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73"></span>A data center typically has locks on some racks for security reasons, and these racks should be located in a well-monitored area. There are also “hot” and “cold” aisles. The hot air from the equipment in the hot aisles is blown out of the racks and recirculates to the ceiling ducts. In the cold aisles, the air is pulled through the equipment by fans within that equipment.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch2lev2sec4">Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable</h4>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">UTP</p>
        <p class="box-para">Unshielded twisted-pair</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Unshielded twisted-pair (<a id="ch2key24" href="glossary.xhtml#glo658"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>UTP</strong></span></a>) cable plays an important role in computer networking. The most common twisted-pair standards used for computer networking today are Category 6 (CAT6), Category 6a (CAT6a), and Category 5e (CAT5e). CAT6 cable provides data rates up to 1000Mbps over a maximum distance of 100 meters. CAT6a is an improved version of CAT6 that supports 10Gbps (10GBASE-T) Ethernet.</p>
        <p class="noindent">CAT5e cable is an enhanced version of CAT5 that provides improved performance. CAT6 provides even better performance and bandwidth of 250MHz. CAT5/5e twisted-pair cable contains four color-coded pairs of 24-gauge wires terminated with an RJ-45 connector. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig06">Figure 2-6</a> shows an example of a CAT5e cable terminated with an RJ-45 modular plug. CAT6 twisted-pair cable also contains four color-coded wires, but the wire gauge is 23AWG. CAT6 cable has a stiffer feel than CAT5e.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The precise manner in which the twist of CAT6/5e/5 cable is maintained, even at the terminations, provides a significant increase in signal transmission performance. CAT5/5e standards allow 0.5 inch of untwisted cable pair at the termination. CAT6 has an even tighter requirement and allows for only 0.375 inch of untwisted cable at the termination. The termination is the point where the cable is connected to terminals in a modular plug, jack, or patch panel.</p>
        <p class="noindent">CAT8/7/6/5e/5 twisted-pair cable contains four twisted wire pairs, for a total of eight wires. In twisted-pair cable, none of the wires in the wire pairs are connected to ground. The signals on the wires are set up for a high (+) and low (–) signal line. The (+) indicates that the phase relationship of the signal on the wire is positive, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"></span> and the (–) indicates that the phase of the signal on the wire is negative; both signals are relative to a virtual ground. This is called a <a id="ch2key25" href="glossary.xhtml#glo57"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>balanced mode</strong></span></a> of operation, and the balance of the two wire pairs helps maintain the required level of performance in terms of crosstalk and noise rejection.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"></span>CAT1 and CAT2 cable specifications are not defined in the TIA/EIA 568-B standard. The first category specification is for CAT3, although CAT3 has been replaced with CAT5e or better. CAT4 is not listed in the table because the category was removed from the TIA/EIA 568-B standard as its data capacity specification is outdated. The Category 5 cable standard was established in 1991, and many computer networks are still using older CAT5 cables. Certified CAT5 cabling works well in both Ethernet and Fast Ethernet networking environments that run 10Mbps Ethernet and 100Mbps Fast Ethernet data rates. Note that the term <a id="ch2key26" href="glossary.xhtml#glo202"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Fast Ethernet</strong></span></a> is used to describe the 100Mbps data rate for Ethernet networks.</p>

These terms describe excessive data traffic that is slowing down computer communications even in Fast Ethernet networks. Basically, the demands on the network exceed the performance capabilities of the CAT5 cable. In fact, CAT 5 cabling is no longer recommended. The slowdown of data is of major concern in computer networks. Slowdowns mean file access time is delayed, productivity is affected, and the time required to complete a task is increased. A slowdown in a network could cost a company money. Can you imagine the consequences if a slowdown in your network caused a delay in the company’s billing?</p>

        <p class="noindent">TIA/EIA ratified the CAT5e cabling specification in 1999 to address the continuing need for greater data-handling capacity in computer networks. The enhanced CAT5 cable (CAT5e) provides an improvement in cable performance, and if all components of a cable installation are done according to specification, CAT5e supports full-duplex <a id="ch2key29" href="glossary.xhtml#glo233"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong></span></a> (1000Mbps Ethernet) using all four wire pairs. <a id="ch2key30" href="glossary.xhtml#glo226"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Full-duplex</strong></span></a> means that the computer system can transmit and receive at the same time. TIA/EIA ratified the CAT6 cabling specification in June 2002. CAT6 cable provides even better performance and 250MHz of bandwidth, and it maintains backward compatibility with CAT5/5e. CAT6 can support 10Gbps data rates over a distance of less than 100 meters. <a id="ch2key31" href="glossary.xhtml#glo84"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>CAT6a</strong></span></a> supports 10Gbps data rates up to 100 meters.

        <p class="noindent">In some applications, a wire screen or metal foil shield is placed around twisted-pair cable. Cable with the addition of a shield is called <a id="ch2key33" href="glossary.xhtml#glo592"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>STP</strong></span></a> (shielded twisted-pair) cable. The addition of this shield reduces the potential for electromagnetic interference (<a id="ch2key34" href="glossary.xhtml#glo184"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>EMI</strong></span></a>) as long as the shield is grounded. EMI originates from devices such as motors and power lines and from some lighting devices, such as fluorescent lights.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">The shield on the twisted-pair cable does not eliminate all potentially interfering noise (EMI), but it does greatly reduce noise interference. There is an active debate in the networking community about whether UTP or STP is superior. It is important to note that the objective of both types of cables is to successfully transport data from the telecommunications closet to the work area. Industry testing on STP cable has shown that the addition of a shield does increase the usable bandwidth of the cable by increasing the noise rejection between each of the wire pairs. However, tests have shown that there is not a significant advantage to placing a shield over a properly installed four-pair 100-ohm UTP cable. In addition, STP is more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"></span>expensive, and the increased cost may not justify the benefits. For now, most manufacturers are recommending the use of UTP cable for cabling computer networks except in very noisy environments.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Category 7 (CAT7) and Category 8 (CAT8) are both shielded twisted-pair cables. Because they are shielded, they are able to operate at higher bandwidth or frequency. CAT7 can operate up to 600MHz, and can operate up to 1000MHz (that is, 1GHz). Both are capable of supporting 10Gbps up to 100 meters. CAT8 can operate over a operate up to 2000Mhz (that is, 2GHz) and is capable of supporting up to 40Gbps over a distance of 30 meters. This is because copper cabling attenuation in twisted-pair significantly increases with higher frequency. Therefore, the effective length of CAT8 has been reduced and optimized to 30 meters to reduce attenuation. The physical characteristics, cost, and speed of CAT7 and CAT8 make these options suitable for data center cabling.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A common question when selecting twisted-pair cabling is whether to use PVC or plenum. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is commonly used as a cable insulation or jacket that consists of chemical compounds that emit toxic smoke when burned. Plenum-rated cable has special coating that emits less toxic smoke when burned. It is important to check your local regulations to make sure you install the proper cabling.</p>

        <p class="noindent">In a LAN, the proper alignment of the transmit and receive pairs is managed by a switch or hub; it is not typically managed in the cable. Remember that in a star topology, all network communication travels through a switch or hub. An “X” or “uplink” on a switch or hub input port indicates a cross-connected input. This means that transmit and receive pairs are internally swapped to maintain proper signal alignment of the TX and RX pairs. Even if “X” or “uplink” is missing, the switch or hub still properly aligns the TX and RX wire pairs. There is an exception to this on many switches and hubs: Some switches and hubs have an input port that can be selected to be “straight” or “crossed.” These ports are typically used in uplink applications when connecting a switch or hub to another switch or hub. If a device has a cross-connected port, a straight-through cable is used because the device is providing the alignment. Just remember that proper alignment of the transmit and receive pair must be maintained in order for the computers to communicate. Also keep in mind that if there is a TX/RX reversal of the wires, you will not see a link light.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Terminating CAT6 Horizontal Link Cable</h5>
        <p class="noindent">This section presents the steps required for terminating a CAT6 cable using the AMP SL series termination procedure, AMP SL tool, CAT6 cable, and AMP SL Series AMP-TWIST-6S Category 6 modular jacks. In this example, an RJ-45 jack is used to terminate each end of the cable. One end connects to a wall plate in the network work area. The other end terminates into a CAT6 RJ-45 patch panel, which is typically located in a LAN network closet. It is important to document your cable patching using some form of patch management. It is much easier to look up your documentation than to physically go to the site to verify the configuration.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The technical specifications and assembly requirements are more stringent with CAT6 than with earlier cable categories. Therefore, you must take more care when terminating a CAT6 cable. However, advancements in the tools and connectors have actually made it easier to terminate CAT6 compared to using the old punchdown tools.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The steps for terminating the CAT6 horizontal link cables are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="num">Inspect the cable for any damage that might have occurred during installation. Examples of damage to look for include nicked or cut wires and possible stretching of the cable.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">At the work area outlet end, add about 1 foot extra and cut the wire. (It is good to leave a little extra in case you make an error in installation and have to redo the termination. Remember that you can’t splice a CAT6 cable.) Then <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"></span>coil the extra cable and insert it in the receptacle box. At the distribution end, route the cable and create a <em>slack loop</em>—extra cable looped at the distribution end that is used if the equipment must be moved. In cases where you are having the cable pulled through ductwork or conduit by an installer, make sure to specify that extra cable length will be run. The amount will vary for each installation. In general, allow 5 meters extra in the telecommunications closet and 5 meters extra in the work area.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Place a bend-limiting strain-relief boot on the cable, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig14">Figure 2-14</a>(a). (This boot is used in the last step to secure the RJ-45 jack.) Then strip approximately 3 inches of cable jacket from the UTP cable, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig14">Figure 2-14</a>(b). Be careful not to nick or cut the wires as you do this.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Assembling the Straight-Through CAT5e/5 Patch Cable</h5>
        <p class="noindent">This section presents a technique for assembling a straight-through CAT5e/5 patch cable. In a straight-through patch cable, the wire pairs in the cable connect to the same pin numbers on each end of the CAT5e/5 patch cable. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig22">Figure 2-22</a> shows a CAT5e patch cable with RJ-45 modular plugs.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"></span>The steps for making a straight-through patch cable are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="num">Inspect the cable for any damage that might have occurred during installation, such as nicked or cut wires or stretching of the cable.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Measure the cable to length, add about 6 inches extra, and cut the wire. (It is good to have a little extra in case you make an error in installation and have to redo the termination. Remember that you can’t splice CAT5e/5 twisted-pair cable.)</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Use a cable stripper to strip approximately 0.75 inch of the cable jacket from the end of the cable. (<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig23">Figure 2-23</a> illustrates how to use a cable stripper.) Remove the cable insulation by rotating the insulation stripper around the wire until the wire jacket is loose and easily removable. (Note that these cable strippers must be periodically adjusted so that the blade cuts through the outer insulation only. If the blades are set too deep, they will nick the wires, and the process must be repeated after the damaged portion of the cable is cut away. You need to be careful to not nick the insulation.)</p>

Be careful to avoid creating a split pair connection (that is, using a wire from one pair and a wire from another pair to make a connection). A split pair connection may create interference and crosstalk problems, thus preventing the cable from passing a certification test. This problem is discussed in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2lev1sec5">Section 2-5</a>, “<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2lev1sec5">Cable Testing and Certification</a>.”</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section discusses issues and specifications for certifying CAT6 cable. It also examines the parameters that are defined by the TIA/EIA 568-B channel specifications. The specifications presented define the basis for most twisted-pair certification. CAT7 and CAT8 promise improved performance capability, and a good task would be to ask students what is unique about certifying CAT7 or CAT8 cable. Students are likely to say that the cable and the connectors have improved performance specifications—and this is correct. This section concludes with examples of conducting CAT6 cable tests.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The need for increased data rates is pushing the technology of twisted-pair cable to even greater performance requirements and placing greater demands on accurate testing of the cable infrastructure. Twisted-pair copper cable now allows data speeds up to 40Gbps. The TIA/EIA 568-B standard defines the minimum cable specifications for twisted-pair categories.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The CAT8/7/6/5e designations are minimum performance measurements of the cables and the attached terminating hardware, such as RJ-45 plugs, jacks, and patch panels.

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"></span>The list that follows describes some of the parameters listed in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02tab04">Table 2-4</a>:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Attenuation (insertion loss):</strong> This parameter defines the amount of loss in signal strength as the signal propagates down the wire. It is caused by the resistance of the twisted-pair cable, the connectors, and leakage of the electrical signal through the cable insulation. Attenuation also increases with an increase in frequencies due to the inductance and capacitance of the cable. The cable test results will report a margin. Margin for attenuation (insertion loss) is defined as the difference between the measured value and the limit for the test. If the margin shows a negative value, the test has failed. A negative value is produced when the measured value is less than the limit. The limit for attenuation (insertion loss) at 100 MHz for CAT6 is 21.3 dB, for CAT6a is 20.9dB, for CAT7 is 20.8dB, for CAT7a is 20.3dB, and for CAT8 is 6.5dB. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94"></span>It is also important to note that for UTP cables, there is a limit on how much the cable can be bent. This limit, called the <em>bend radius</em>, is four times the outer jacket diameter. Bends exceeding this limit can introduce attenuation loss.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>NEXT:</strong> When current travels in a wire, an electromagnetic field is created. This field can induce voltage in adjacent wires, resulting in crosstalk. <a id="ch2key47" href="glossary.xhtml#glo128"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Crosstalk</strong></span></a> is signal coupling within a cable. On analog land-line telephones, users could sometimes faintly hear another conversation; this is where the term crosstalk originated. Near-end crosstalk, or NEXT, is a measure of the level of crosstalk. The measurement of NEXT is called <em>near-end testing</em> because the receiver is more likely to pick up the crosstalk from the transmit to the receive wire pairs at the ends. The transmit signal levels at each end are strong, and the cable is more susceptible to crosstalk at this point. In addition, the receive signal levels have been attenuated due to normal cable path loss and are significantly weaker than the transmit signal. A high NEXT (dB) value is desirable.</p><div class="box">

        <li><p class="bullet"><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig29">Figure 2-29</a> graphically depicts NEXT. The shaded areas show where the near-end crosstalk occurs. The margin is the difference between the measured value and the limit. A negative number means the measured value is less than the limit, and therefore the measurement fails. Crosstalk is more problematic at higher data rates (for example, 1Gbps, 10Gbps) than at lower rates. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig30">Figure 2-30</a> shows that CAT6 cable has a built-in separator to help minimize crosstalk among wire pairs. This separator is used to keep each wire pair a minimum distance from other wire pairs. This separator reduces crosstalk at higher frequencies and helps provide improved signal bandwidth; the cable therefore supports faster data rates. This separator also helps improve the far-end crosstalk. Note, however, that not all cable manufacturers use separators.</p>

A higher PSNEXT value is desirable because it indicates better cable performance.</p>

        <li><p class="bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95"></span><strong>Equal-level FEXT (ELFEXT):</strong> This measurement differs from NEXT in that it is for the far end of the cable. In addition, the ELFEXT measurement does not depend on the length of the cable. This is because ELFEXT is obtained by subtracting the attenuation value from the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) loss. Higher ELFEXT values (dB) indicate that the signals at the far end of the cable are larger than the crosstalk measured at the far end. A larger ELFEXT (dB) value is desirable. A poor ELFEXT value can result in data loss. Data loss prevention begins with properly terminating your cabling.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Power-sum ELFEXT (PSELFEXT):</strong> PSELFEXT uses all four wire pairs to obtain a combined ELFEXT performance measurement. This value is the difference between the test signal level and the crosstalk measured at the far end of the cable. A higher PSELFEXT value indicates better cable performance.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Attenaution to Crosstalk Ratio (ACR):</strong> This measurement compares the signal level from a transmitter at the far end to the crosstalk measured at the near end. A larger ACR value indicates that the cable has a greater data capacity and also indicates the cable’s ability to handle a greater bandwidth. Essentially, it is a combined measurement of the quality of the cable. A higher ACR value (dB) is desirable.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Power-sum ACR (PSACR):</strong> PSACR uses all four wire pairs to obtain the measure of the attenuation/crosstalk ratio. This is a measurement of the difference between PSNEXT and attenuation (insertion loss). The difference is measured in dB, and higher PSACR dB values indicate better cable performance.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Return loss:</strong> An important twisted-pair cable measurement is return loss. This measurement provides a measure of the ratio of power transmitted into a cable to the amount of power returned or reflected. The signal reflection is due to impedance changes in the cable link and the impedance changes contributing to cable loss. Cables are not perfect, and there will always be some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96"></span>reflection. Examples of the causes of impedance changes are non-uniformity in impedance throughout the cable, the diameter of the copper, cable handling, and dielectric differences. A low return loss value (dB) is desirable.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Propagation delay:</strong> This is a measure of the amount of time it takes for a signal to propagate from one end of the cable to the other. The delay of the signal is affected by the nominal velocity of propagation (NVP) of the cable. NVP is some percentage of the velocity of light and is dependent on the type of cable being tested. The typical delay value for CAT5/5e UTP cable is about 5.7 ns per meter. The TIA/EIA specification allows for 548 ns for the maximum 100 meter run for CAT5e, CAT6, CAT6a, CAT7, and CAT7a.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Delay skew:</strong> This is a measure of the difference in arrival time between the fastest signal and the slowest signal in a UTP wire pair. It is critical in high-speed data transmission that the data on the wire pair arrives at the other end at the same time. If the wire lengths of different wire pairs are significantly different, the data on one wire will take longer to propagate along the wire and arrive at the receiver at a different time and potentially create distortion of the data and data packet loss. The wire pair with the shortest length typically has the least delay skew.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
        <p class="note-t">Note</p>
        <p class="note-para">The power-sum measurements are critical for high-speed data communication over UTP. It has also been shown that twisted-pair cable can handle Gigabit data rates over a distance up to 100 meters. However, the Gigabit data rate capability of twisted-pair requires the use of all four wire pairs in the cable, with each pair handling 250Mbps of data. The total bit rate is 4 × 250Mbps, or 1Gbps—hence the need to obtain the combined performance measurements of all four wire pairs.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Even though CAT8 can deliver 40Gbps (40 Gigabit Ethernet), it is not widely adopted in the industry because network equipment is not available to deliver 40Gbps. 10Gbps is the maximum speed over twisted-pair that network equipment can deliver. 40Gbps is more typically available over fiber-ready interfaces. This section focuses on the widely used 10Gbps Ethernet over copper. The increase in the required bandwidth for transporting a Gigabit data transfer rate is placing increased demands on the copper cable as well as the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98"></span>hardware used for terminating the cable ends and for connecting to the networking equipment. Three improvements are required for transmitting the higher data bit rates over copper cabling:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p class="bullet">Improve the cable so it can carry greater bandwidth.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">Improve the electronics used to transmit and receive (recover) the data.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">Utilize improvements in both the cable and electronics to facilitate greater bandwidths and distances</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">This section examines the changes in technology that are required to enable 10 Gigabit (10GBASE-T) data transmission over copper. It first presents an overview of 10 Gigabit Ethernet over copper. Then it examines the modifications required to the technical specs (CAT6a and CAT7/7a) for testing and certifying twisted-pair copper cable transporting 10 Gigabit data rates. Finally, this section examines how 10 Gigabit data is actually transmitted.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch2lev2sec14">Overview</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The standard for 10Gbps is <a id="ch2key48" href="glossary.xhtml#glo271"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>IEEE 802.3an-2006 10GBASE-T</strong></span></a>. This standard was developed to support running 10Gbps data over twisted-pair cabling. It requires the bandwidth to be increased from 250MHz to 500MHz. In addition, this standard supports distances up to 100 meters. At one time, most people assumed that higher data rates would be limited to fiber optics. While that is still true for lengthy runs (over 100 meters), twisted-pair copper is finding a place in the horizontal runs from telecommunications closets to work areas.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch2key49" href="glossary.xhtml#glo30"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Alien crosstalk (AXT)</strong></span></a> is unwanted signal coupling from one permanent link to another; it is an important issue at higher data rates, such as with 10GBASE-T. Basically, AXT is the coupling of a signal from one four-pair cable to another four-pair cable. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig31">Figure 2-31</a> depicts the AXT from one four-pair cable to another four-pair cable. The other key measurements for 10GBASE-T are NEXT (PSANEXT), FEXT (PSAACRF), and return loss. <a id="ch2key50" href="glossary.xhtml#glo482"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>PSANEXT</strong></span></a> (power-sum alien near-end crosstalk) and <a id="ch2key51" href="glossary.xhtml#glo481"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>PSAACRF</strong></span></a> (power-sum alien attenuation to crosstalk ratio) are new measurements for NEXT and FEXT that incorporate measures for AXT. AXT is considered to be the main electrical limiting parameter for 10 Gigabit Ethernet. AXT causes disturbances in the neighboring cable. It is difficult for the electronics to cancel the AXT noise created; therefore, new cables have been developed to support 10Gbps data rates. The newer cables have improved cable separation, and new connector types have also been developed to help meet the required specifications to support 10 Gigabit Ethernet.</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Transmission of data over twisted-pair cabling relies on the signals being “balanced” over the wire pairs. The balance, or symmetry, of the signal over the wire pairs helps minimize unwanted leakage of the signal.

This same technique is also used for 1000Mbps (that is, 1Gbps) data rates, except that the 1000Mbps signal is split into four 250Mbps data channels. The system requires the use of signal conditioners and digital signal processing (DSP) circuits for both transmission and reception. The data transmission for 10 Gigabit uses a <a id="ch2key57" href="glossary.xhtml#glo382"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>multilevel encoding</strong></span></a> technique, as illustrated in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig33">Figure 2-33</a>.

        <p class="noindent">10GBASE-T data transmission also requires the use of DSP compensation techniques. The DSP circuitry provides many functions, such as signal conditioning and echo cancellation. Any time a signal is transmitted down a cable, part of the signal is reflected. This reflection adds to overall signal degradation and limits the performance of the system. In 10GBASE-T, the transmit and receive signals share the same wire pair. This is called <em>full-duplex transmission</em> and requires the use of a device called a <a id="ch2key58" href="glossary.xhtml#glo262"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>hybrid echo cancellation circuit</strong></span></a>. The hybrid circuit removes the transmitted signal from the receive signal.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The final issue with 10GBASE-T signal transmission is the performance of the cable. As mentioned previously, return loss, insertion loss, and crosstalk are all key limiting issues for 10GBASE-T. Crosstalk is the most important factor. The types of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101"></span>crosstalk observed are AXT, NEXT, FEXT, and ELFEXT. The cabling systems that support 10GBASE-T operation with links up to 100 meters are CAT6 with the foil screen, augmented CAT6 (CAT6a), CAT7, and CAT7a.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section examines some of the cable considerations and common issues that a network administrator may face with both CAT6 and CAT5e cable tests. It is important that a network administrator monitor all parts of a cable installation, from pulling to terminating the cable ends. A cable may fail a certification test due to multiple types of problems, such as problems with installation, cable stretching, and the cable failing to meet manufacturer specifications. This section discusses these types of problems and describes how to use certification reports to understand failures of CAT6 and CAT5e cabling.</p>
        <p class="noindent">If you obtain bad power-sum measurements or NEXT or FEXT measurements during network testing, there might be a problem with the installation. The certification report provided in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig34">Figure 2-34</a> indicates that this cable does not pass CAT6 certification, as shown by the X in the upper-right corner of the report. This test indicates a NEXT failure, which is most likely due to a problem at the terminations. This error is commonly due to the installer allowing too much untwisted cable at the termination point. Remember that the twist in UTP cable must be maintained to less than 0.375 inch. This certification test result should prompt you to inspect the terminations to see whether any terminations have too much untwisted cable and verify whether there is a procedure problem with the installation.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch2lev2sec19">Cable Stretching</h4>
        <p class="noindent">It is important to avoid stretching UTP cable because doing so changes the electrical characteristics of the cable, increasing the attenuation and crosstalk. The maximum pulling tension (expressed in lb-ft) is specified in the manufacturer’s data sheets.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch2lev2sec20">Cable Failing to Meet Manufacturer Specifications</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Occasionally, manufacturers experience problems with cable failing to meet specifications. For example, a bad production run may cause the cable to fail to meet minimum specifications. Repeated test failures with no apparent cause could indicate that the problem is with the cable. This rarely happens, but a bad cable production run could be the culprit. As a network manager, you need to isolate the source of the problem.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig35">Figure 2-35</a> shows a CAT6 certification report which indicates that the cable failed due to excessive insertion loss. The certification report shows that the cable length for pair 7–8 is 311 feet. The maximum cable length for a permanent link is 295 feet. Therefore, this cable run is too long to be certifiable.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section presents test results for several CAT5e cable tests. There are many CAT5e horizontal cable runs already in place, and these runs support 100Mbps data rates. Therefore, it is important for a network administrator to have a good understanding of how to certify CAT5e links. The goal of this section is to acquaint you with possible CAT5e test results and problems you might encounter on the job. The procedures presented are the same for CAT6 except that the test mode of the cable analyzer must be set to CAT5e performance specifications. The testers used <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105"></span>for conducting the CAT5e certification reports in this section are the Fluke OMNIScanner and OMNIRemote.</p>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Test 1</h5>
        <p class="noindent">UTP cable testing is not restricted to long cables. Short patch cables (around 3 feet) can and should also be tested. It’s a good idea to have a record of even short patch cables meeting CAT5e requirements.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig36">Figure 2-36</a> shows an OMNIScanner certification report which verifies that the cable passes the CAT5e link test. This report shows that the length of the cable tested is 3 feet.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A second test on the same 3-foot cable used in Test 1 shows that the cable no longer meets CAT5e requirements (see <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig37">Figure 2-37</a>). The test results indicate FAIL. In this case, careful inspection of the cable shows that it has been cut or nicked. This underscores the importance of documenting the network installation and having a record of the cable link having been certified. Test 1 showed that the cable met specifications, but the cable has since been damaged and no longer meets the CAT5e link specifications.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In this example, the cable has failed a wiremap test. Not only is the text highlighted, but there is an exclamation point preceding the text that indicates a failure. A quick check of the wiremap test shows that the number 4 wire was not detected at the remote.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A third cable test, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig38">Figure 2-38</a>, also generates the test result FAIL. Examination of the attenuation and return loss menu shows that the cable failed to meet CAT5e attenuation and return loss specifications. The permitted attenuation in CAT5e cable is 24 dB. However, the 1–2 and 3–6 pairs have attenuation losses of 38.0 dB and 41.1 dB. Both cases greatly exceed the permitted maximum. An arrow points to these attenuation loss scores.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This cable also fails return loss testing for pairs 1–2 and 3–6. CAT5e cable permits 10 dB of return loss. The report shows that the pairs failed the return loss test at both the OMNIScanner and the OMNIRemote test unit. This cable fails CAT5e certification based on its attenuation or return loss. In fact, this cable also fails the NEXT, ELFEXT, and PSELFEXT tests. Any of these failures is sufficient to prevent this cable from being certified.</p>

Examination of the certification report shows that the cable failed the delay skew test. This cable exceeds the maximum skew allowed by TIA/EIA 568-B. In addition, this cable fails attenuation, ELFEXT, and PSELFEXT tests. The cable is not certified.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The measured delay skew of 47 ns exceeds the tester setting of 45 ns. However, the TIA/EIA 568-B standard permits a delay skew of 50 ns, so actually this cable meets delay skew requirements for CAT5e cable. Should the cable have been certified? Look at the length measurement for the 3–6 pair length. The cable is 1040 feet (317 meters) long. Remember that the maximum cable length for a CAT5e cable run is 100 meters.</p>

        <p class="noindent">You have just seen a few examples of CAT5e link tests that provide actual test data for various cable problems that you might encounter on the job. In the tests where a failure was detected, the tester displays a FAIL screen, and the certification report identifies the problem. The following is a summary of the test results:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Test 1:</strong> The certification report shows the test result PASS.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Test 2:</strong> The certification report shows the test result FAIL. The report shows that the cable failed the wiremap test.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Test 3:</strong> This cable test generated the test result FAIL. Examination of the attenuation and return loss shows that the cable failed to meet CAT5e attenuation and return loss specifications. The cable also failed NEXT, ELFEXT, PSNEXT, and PSELFEXT tests.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Test 4:</strong> The certification report shows the cable failing the CAT5e link test. Examination of the report shows that the cable failed the delay skew measurement because the cable length exceeded the 100 meter maximum. The cable also failed the attenuation, ELFEXT, and PSELFEXT tests.</p></li>

        <h5 class="h5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110"></span>Wired Connectivity and Performance Issues Summary</h5>
        <p class="noindent">There are many other issues associated with troubleshooting wired connectivity and performance issues, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Open/short:</strong> A cable may have a wire connection that is open or shorted. This issue is most often associated with patch cables and wall plates.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Incorrect pin-out:</strong> This error should be easily detected when conducting a wiremap test on a terminated cable. A cable tester provides a visual indicator of the wiremap.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Incorrect cable type:</strong> This problem usually occurs when data speeds increase and a cable is not designed to support the higher data rate. In addition, an application might require a shielded twisted-pair cable or a plenum-rated cable. It is important to make sure the proper cable has been used.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Bad port:</strong> When troubleshooting, it might be discovered that a port is not “hot,” meaning that it is not connecting to the network. You have to make sure the cable to the switch port is connected and the cable link is good. Next, you need to verify that the switch port or wall port is functional. If it isn’t, it needs to be replaced.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Damaged cables:</strong> This problem is usually associated with cable installation, but it can be associated with patch cables. In either case, a cable tester can be used to identify the problem.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Bent pins:</strong> This condition can be associated with connectors on a computer motherboard and with a connector cable such as a DTE V.35 cable or other types of serial cables. If this condition occurs, you can carefully straighten the cable pins with needle-nose pliers.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Bad ports:</strong> A poorly terminated UTP plug can be susceptible to RFI that could degrade data transfers and result in poor signal integrity. A bad or broken UTP jack can cause an intermittent network connection.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">A useful tool for verifying continuity with cable wiring is a multimeter. This device is used to measure voltage, current, and resistance. A basic multimeter function related to cabling is conducting a continuity check to verify that two ends are connected.</p>
