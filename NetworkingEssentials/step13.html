        <p class="noindent">Safety should always be the number-one priority in every operation and for every workplace. Therefore, the U.S. government passed the Occupational Safety and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_709"></span>Health Act (<a id="ch13key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo430"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>OSH Act</strong></span></a>) in 1970 and created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (<a id="ch13key2" href="glossary.xhtml#glo431"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>OSHA</strong></span></a>) to oversee and enforce safety standards in the workplace. OSHA’s mission is to ensure safe and healthful workplaces by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance. Every employer must comply with all applicable OSHA standards.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The National Fire Protection Association (<a id="ch13key3" href="glossary.xhtml#glo407"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>NFPA</strong></span></a>) is an organization that works closely with OSHA on standards and codes to help create safe environments and to prevent accidents due to fire, electrical and related hazards. OSHA has asked NFPA to develop many standards to assist employers and employees in complying with the safety regulations. Compliance with OSHA codes and regulations is mandatory. Although compliance with NFPA standards is not mandatory, through compliance employers can demonstrate and ensure compliance with OSHA requirements. To put it simply, OSHA tells us what to do, and NFPA tells us how to do it. Therefore, many OSHA standards refer to NFPA codes.</p>

        <p class="noindent">An exit route is a continuous and unobstructed path of travel from any location within a workplace to a place of safety. 29 CFR 1910.36 specifies the basic location requirements for the proper design and construction of exit routes:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit route must be a permanent part of the workplace.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit must be separated from other parts of the workplace, and the separation materials must be fire resistant.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">An opening into an exit must be protected by a self-closing fire door that remains closed and must be limited to only allow exit access.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The number of exit routes must be adequate for all employees to be able to evacuate safely during an emergency.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit discharge must lead directly outside or to a street, a walkway, a refuge area, a public way, or an open space, which must be large enough to accommodate the building occupants.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit door must be unlocked from the inside so employees can open the exit door at all times.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">A side-hinged exit door must be used so that the door can swing out in the direction of exit travel.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_710"></span>An exit route must be at least 7 feet, 6 inches high and at least 28 inches wide at all points.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">29 CFR 1910.37 specifies requirements for employers to properly maintain exit routes in order to prepare the workplace for a successful emergency evacuation and minimize further danger to employees:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit route must be free of explosive or highly flammable furnishings and other decorations.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Exit routes must be arranged so employees will not have to travel toward a high-hazard area.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit route must not be obstructed by any materials or equipment. It must not go through locked doors or dead-end corridors.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Safeguards designed to protect employees, such as sprinkler systems, alarm systems, exit lighting, and fire doors, must be working properly.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">There must be adequate lighting for each exit route.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit must be clearly visible and marked by a sign reading “Exit.”</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit door must be free of decorations or signs that obscure the visibility of the exit door.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">If the direction to the exit is not apparent, signs must be posted to show the direction to the exit.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Each exit sign must be illuminated, and the word “Exit” must be in plainly legible letters.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Fire-retardant paints or solutions must be maintained often enough to renew their properties.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">During construction, repairs, or alterations, exit routes must be maintained and available at all times.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must install and maintain an operable alarm system to alert employees of fire and other emergencies.</p></li>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec3">Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38)</h4>
        <p class="noindent">An employer must have an emergency action plan (<a id="ch13key5" href="glossary.xhtml#glo175"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>EAP</strong></span></a>). An emergency action plan facilitates and organizes employer and employee actions during workplace emergencies. If there are more than 10 employees, the plan must be in writing, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_711"></span>it must be kept in the workplace and available for employee review. An emergency action plan must include the following, at a minimum:</p>
        <div class="box">

        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">In addition, employers should have an alarm system to alert employees. Employers must designate and train enough people to assist in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of employees. Employers must review the emergency action plan with each employee when the plan is initially developed, when an employee is initially hired to the job, when actions or responsibilities under the plan change, or when the plan changes.</p>

        <p class="noindent">As with having an emergency action plan, an employer is required to have a fire prevention plan (<a id="ch13key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo218"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>FPP</strong></span></a>). As a matter of fact, the emergency action plan and fire prevention plan typically go hand in hand. Many organizations combine the two plans into one document. The written fire prevention plan must be available to the employees and kept at the workplace. For employers with 10 or fewer employees, the plan may be communicated orally. The purpose of the fire prevention plan is to prevent a fire from occurring or spreading in a workplace. A fire prevention plan must include the following, at a minimum:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">A list of all major fire hazards, proper handling and storage procedures for hazardous materials, potential ignition sources and their control, and the type of fire protection equipment necessary to control each major hazard</p></li>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec5">Portable Fire Extinguishers (29 CFR 1910.157)</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Fire extinguishers are a smaller form of fire suppression. However, when used properly, fire extinguishers can save lives and property by putting out small fires or controlling a fire until additional help arrives. There are five types of fire extinguisher ratings, and each rating denotes a different class of fire:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Type A:</strong> These fire extinguishers are used for combustible solid materials such as paper, wood, cloth, and some types of plastic. These extinguishers typically use water and dry chemicals to suppress fire.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Type B:</strong> These fire extinguishers are used to suppress fire originated from flammable liquids and gas. These extinguishers typically use foam, powder, or carbon dioxide.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Type C:</strong> These fire extinguishers are used on electrical fires originated from sources such as wires, electrical panels, and circuit breakers. These extinguishers typically use dry power or carbon dioxide.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Type D:</strong> These fire extinguishers are used on combustible or flammable metals such as magnesium, aluminum, potassium, and sodium. This class of fire can only be suppressed with dry powder extinguishers.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Type K:</strong> These fire extinguishers are used to suppress kitchen fires caused by cooking fats, greases, and oils. These extinguishers use wet chemical to suppress this class of fire.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The portable fire extinguishers standard specifies the placement, use, maintenance, and testing of portable fire extinguishers provided for the use of employees. Employers may exempt themselves from most of the portable fire extinguisher requirements if they develop a written emergency action plan that is complete and in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38. The portable fire extinguishers standard specifies the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must mount, locate, and identify portable fire extinguishers for easy employee access.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Portable fire extinguishers cannot have carbon tetrachloride or chlorobromomethane extinguishing agents.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must remove from service portable fire extinguishers that use soldered or riveted shell self-generating soda acid, self-generating foam, and gas cartridge water.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must provide, select, and distribute portable extinguishers based on the class of anticipated workplace fires; fire extinguishers are classified by their ability to handle specific classes and sizes of fires.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_713"></span>Employers are responsible for the inspection, maintenance, and testing of all portable fire extinguishers in the workplace.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must ensure that portable fire extinguishers are fully charged, operable, and kept in their designated place at all times.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must provide equivalent protection when extinguishers are removed for maintenance or recharging.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Portable fire extinguishers must be subjected to annual maintenance checks. The maintenance date must be recorded, and the record must be retained for one year after the last entry or for the extinguisher’s shelf life.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must have trained persons with suitable testing equipment, and facilities must conduct hydrostatic testing on portable fire extinguishers.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must remove portable fire extinguishers that fail hydrostatic pressure testing.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">In addition to these requirements, employers must provide training upon initial assignment and at least annually for employees who use fire extinguishers. The training program must familiarize employees with the general principles of fire extinguisher use, fire hazards, and the use of appropriate equipment.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec6">Fixed Extinguishing Systems (29 CFR 1910.160)</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Fixed fire extinguishing/suppression systems are commonly used to protect areas containing valuable or critical equipment, such as data-processing rooms, telecommunication switches, and process control rooms. Their main function is to quickly extinguish a developing fire before extensive damage occurs by filling the protected area with a gas or chemical extinguishing agent. The purpose of 29 CFR 1910.160 is to ensure the safety of employees and prevent possible injury, death, or adverse health consequences caused by the extinguishing agent. This standard includes the following requirements:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">If the system becomes inoperable, employers must notify employees and take any necessary temporary precautions to ensure their safety until the system is restored to operating order. Any defects or impairments must be properly corrected by trained personnel.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">A distinctive alarm or signaling system must be capable of being perceived above ambient noise or light levels when the extinguishing system is discharging.</p></li>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec7">Fire Detection Systems (29 CFR 1910.164)</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Automatic fire detection systems, when combined with other elements of an emergency response and evacuation plan, can significantly reduce property damage, personal injuries, and loss of life due to fire in the workplace. Automatic fire detection systems do this by using electronic sensors to detect the smoke, heat, or flames from a fire and providing early warning. Their main function is to quickly identify a developing fire and alert building occupants and emergency <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_715"></span>response personnel before extensive damage occurs. 29 CFR 1910.164 includes the following requirements:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must restore all fire detection systems and components to normal operating condition as promptly as possible after each test or alarm.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must maintain all systems in an operable condition.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers are responsible for servicing, testing, and adjusting fire detectors and fire detection systems as often as needed to maintain proper reliability and operating condition. The work must be performed by a trained person.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Fire detectors must be cleaned at regular periodic intervals.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Employers must ensure that fire detection equipment is protected from mechanical or physical impact, weather, and corrosion.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">The purpose of 29 CFR 1910.1200 is to ensure that the hazards of all chemicals are classified and the information concerning the classified hazards is communicated to employers and employees. It requires that the chemical manufacturer, distributor, or importer provide safety data sheets (<a id="ch13key7" href="glossary.xhtml#glo536"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SDS</strong></span></a>), formerly known as material safety data sheets (<a id="ch13key8" href="glossary.xhtml#glo368"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MSDS</strong></span></a>), for each hazardous chemical it produces or imports. An employer must have an SDS in the workplace for each hazardous chemical it uses. The SDS includes information such as product identifier or manufacturer, physical and chemical properties, chemical hazards, chemical ingredients and composition, first-aid measures, fire-fighting measures, accidental release measures, handling and storage, personal protection, chemical stability and hazardous reactions, and toxicological information.</p>

HVAC systems are critical for computing and data centers. An HVAC system must be properly planned and maintained to ensure that the operating environment is properly maintained. The physical hardware used in a computer center will have recommendations for temperature and humidity. In addition, maintenance personnel for HVAC systems will have access to protected areas; these people must have proper clearance, and safeguards must be in place to allow non-IT staff to have access to these areas.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec11">Door Access</h4>
        <p class="noindent">In computer networks and enterprise data centers, door access is a critical part of physical security. Door access should be controlled through the use of smart cards, proximity cards, or key fobs. Other options for access control include biometrics, such as hand scanners and retinal scanners. <a id="ch13key10" href="glossary.xhtml#glo62"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Biometric systems</strong></span></a> measure and analyze specific characteristics of the human body—for example, DNA, fingerprints, voice and facial patterns, eye retinas, and hand measurements—for the purpose of authentication. Door access control could also be managed using keypads and cipher locks to ensure that only authorized personnel have entry access. To detect unauthorized access, burglar alarms and motion detection alarms can be deployed. Burglar alarms detect when entry points, such as doors or windows, are opened. Motion detection alarms detect movement within monitored areas. In either case, the alarm will sound and the alert notifications will be sent to the proper authority.</p>

        <p class="box-para">Systems that measure and analyze specific characteristics of the human body for the purpose of authentication</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">In some cases, a security guard could be in a position to help control physical access to these areas. It is a common physical security practice for authorized personnel to wear their ID badges with picture and identification information. The security guard will be responsible for checking and validating their badges before allowing them entry access.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another type of commonly deployed physical security is video surveillance. Video surveillance can be used in many areas that require monitoring, such as a data center. Video monitoring in computer spaces is also a necessity to prevent theft and to provide a video record of personnel who access the systems. In some video surveillance systems, video monitoring is triggered by motion detection. When any movement or activity is detected in a monitored area, a surveillance camera with motion detection activates itself and starts capturing video footage. It is important to remember that internal threats are a major concern. Video surveillance is available as CCTV (closed-circuit television) or IP-based video. IP-based video surveillance is becoming more popular today. Many home security camera products, such as Ring, Nest, and Arlo, are affordable and easy to install and manage.</p>

The three major export control regulations are the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). All these regulations have a common theme of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that impacts consumers.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An IT organization can use the guidance of NIST’s Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity to help facilitate compliance. The components of this framework are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to business objectives and the organization’s risk strategy.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_721"></span>The organization’s mission, objectives, stakeholders, and activities are understood and prioritized; this information is used to inform cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and risk management decisions.</p></li>

        <li><p class="bull">The organization’s priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support operational risk decisions.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Access to assets and associated facilities is limited to authorized users, processes, or devices and to authorized activities and transactions.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The organization’s personnel and partners are provided cybersecurity awareness education and are adequately trained to perform their information security–related duties and responsibilities consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Information and records (data) are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Security policies (that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination among organizational entities), processes, and procedures are maintained and used to manage the protection of information systems and assets.</p></li>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev1sec4"><span class="space">13-4</span> Business Policies, Procedures, and Other Best Practices</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Regulations are mandatory rules that are set by government or authorized entities. Organizations must certify that they have complied with all the rules and also must have a way to show that their compliance can be validated through a process such as an audit. Regulations help set many guidelines and practical standards for day-to-day operations.</p>
        <p class="noindent">There are also rules that can be set between entities without being regulated by government. Similar to regulations, these rules define how business should be done, what services can be exchanged, what the service expectations are, what the rules of engagement are, and so on. These rules, once agreed upon by all parties, may be upheld in a court of law. A court can hold parties accountable and responsible for their actions.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In the IT world, two or more parties can enter into a formal agreement, called a service agreement, that articulates the terms and conditions of a service. The agreement specifies many criteria, which include but are not limited to the nature, description, and scope of the service and how the service will be governed, implemented, operated, tested, reported, and financed. Many types of service agreements are used in business. The following sections describe the agreements most commonly used as standard business documents in the IT world.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec23">Memorandum of Understanding</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A memorandum of understanding, or <a id="ch13key17" href="glossary.xhtml#glo366"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MOU</strong></span></a>, is a formal agreement between two or more parties to establish official service partnerships. It outlines the terms and details of each party’s requirements and responsibilities. This document is sometimes called a letter of intent (LOI) because it can be followed with a legally binding contract.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">MOU</p>
        <p class="box-para">Memorandum of understanding, a formal agreement between two or more parties to establish official service partnerships</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_724"></span>MOUs are much less formal than contracts, but they are far more formal than handshakes. Many IT organizations use MOUs to create guidelines with one another as they contribute their efforts and resources toward important projects or for sharing or exchanging IT services without having to enter into the detailed and complex process of contracts.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec24">Service-Level Agreement</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A service-level agreement, or <a id="ch13key18" href="glossary.xhtml#glo558"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SLA</strong></span></a>, is a formal agreement typically between a service provider and a client or an end user. This agreement defines the level of service expected from the service provider. Unlike MOUs, SLAs do not contain details regarding how a service will be provided or delivered, nor do they provide operational guidelines. SLAs simply define what service the end user should expect to receive as well as the levels of service the service provider guarantees. In case of failure to provide the guaranteed level of service, SLAs define the responsibilities of the service provider to restore the guaranteed level of service.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">SLA</p>
        <p class="box-para">Service-level agreement, a formal agreement typically between a service provider and a client or an end user, that defines the level of service expected from the service provider</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Internet service is a prime example of a service that is often the subject of SLAs. SLAs for Internet service vary depending on many factors, such as Internet service provider (ISP), type of Internet technology, and class of Internet service. For example, an SLA for business Internet service will be far more stringent and detailed than an SLA for residential Internet service. Most SLAs for business Internet service include the guaranteed speed, the guaranteed Internet service availability or uptime, the expected response time for repair or service restoration, and the service provider’s penalty for not meeting the guaranteed service level.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Many organizations use SLAs as a way to benchmark their performance. SLAs are very common and popular among cloud service providers. They are used to assure customers of the quality of the service they will receive.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A master service agreement (<a id="ch13key19" href="glossary.xhtml#glo367"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MSA</strong></span></a>) is an overarching document that creates a framework for multiple service-level agreements—hence the term <em>master.</em> An MSA is typically used when entering into a long negotiation of services, where multiple contracts or agreements might be needed. It is set up as the initial agreement to include most but not all the terms and conditions between two or more parties. These terms, such as service definitions, payment terms, warranties, limitations on liability, and termination, are likely not to change. The purpose of an MSA is to speed up and simplify the process for future subsequent agreements. Future subsequent agreements only need to contain the differences from the MSA, thus reducing the time and involvement from all parties.</p>

MLAs are commonly used by software vendors to define how their software can be used and distributed. They also define licensing restrictions and the liabilities and/or penalties associated with a violation. Sometimes, the term MLA is used for an end user license agreement (EULA), which is a more specific agreement for a particular software product.</p>

This type of policy outlines the acceptable use of computer equipment, network, Internet, and other IT-related services. The policy defines rules and constraints that users must accept before accessing IT services. When they accept an AUP, users are held accountable to their actions while using the organization’s IT services. Typically, an AUP contains segments referencing the organization’s policies and standards as well as on adhering to local and federal laws.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec31"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_726"></span>Password Policy</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A password policy sets the rules on the computing passwords for an entire organization. Passwords are the most used method of authentication and are key to accessing any IT services, and they must be safeguarded. It is not easy to safeguard everyone’s password, and a password policy can help by establishing criteria and rules that everyone in the organization has to follow.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The following are some of the common rules included in a password policy:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Password strength/complexity defines the composition requirements of a password. Generally accepted password strength characteristics recommended by NIST are that it be at least eight characters or longer. It should contain at least one uppercase letter, contain at least one lowercase letter, contain at least one number, have at least one special character, and not contain the username.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Password expiration defines the duration for which the password is valid. The expiration time depends entirely on the organization; some prefer 120 days, some prefer 6 months.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Account lockout defines how many times users are allowed to enter an incorrect password before the account is locked out. Also, there may be a lockout time implemented before a user can try reentering the password.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Password reset defines the rules or procedures for resetting the user’s password.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Password sharing restricts users from sharing their password with anyone else.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Currently, a big shift is occurring in how NIST views password strength. The newest Digital Identity Guidelines from NIST favor the use of long passphrases instead of composition rules. These guidelines also recommend using multifactor authentication.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec32">Privileged User Agreement</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A privileged user agreement establishes expectations for the conduct of individuals granted privileged access to an organization’s enterprise systems and services, which may include computing systems, network, databases, data, user accounts, and user processes. This agreement defines different processes to obtain a privileged user account: request, approval, modification, and revocation. The agreement should also entail the type of privileged access granted. The agreement typically has to be signed by the requestor and the approver. It will then be kept as a record for auditing purposes.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec33">Standard Operating Procedure</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure document that describes routine operations accompanied by step-by-step instructions showing how to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_727"></span>perform them. The purpose of an SOP is to ensure quality and consistency of the operations; the operations are to be carried out correctly and in the same manner. Any unit within an organization can have an SOP to streamline operations. For example, onboarding and offboarding procedures could be part of a unit’s SOP, which may detail the list of things that new employees need in order to start performing their required duties, such as physical access, server access, network access, computer assignment, special equipment, and training. The SOP may also address employee termination, listing the access to be revoked and equipment to be returned.</p>

An <a id="ch13key24" href="glossary.xhtml#glo423"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>onboarding</strong></span></a> policy can specify how a new employee is brought into an organization’s IT systems. It defines different types of access a new employee would need to do his/her job, depending on the employee’s roles and responsibilities. An onboarding policy can also cover how a new device can get connected and gain access to the organization’s network. An <a id="ch13key25" href="glossary.xhtml#glo421"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>offboarding</strong></span></a> policy focuses on the termination of employee access and device access when an employee is terminated or no longer in the same role and when a device is decommissioned from the production system.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch13lev2sec35">Other Best Practices</h4>
        <p class="noindent">An organization can have many policies and procedures, and they typically evolve from IT best practices. Best practices are recommended practices that have been proven effective and efficient for other people to adopt as guidelines. If best practices are followed, it is very likely that an organization will meet the compliance standards. This section describes some well-known and widely adopted best practices.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Documentation is a fundamental and very important part of an organization’s operations. Most standards and other compliance documents talk about having good documentation. In networking, documentation typically includes a physical network diagram, a logical network diagram, and a wiring diagram. Good network documentation with detailed information about wiring and port locations is essential for network troubleshooting. When changes are made to a network, the diagrams must be updated. In addition, change management documentation should keep track of any changes, including configuration changes, new installations, or upgrades made to a network and the system. Change management documentation accompanies a change management policy, which governs the change process of an organization; the typical processes are notification, approval, authorized downtime, and notification of change.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Having configuration standards is another widely adopted best practice. Such standards help ensure that every network device has a good baseline configuration that meets both operational and security requirements. NIST provides recommendations on network device hardening, including recommended practices used in changing default credentials, generating new encryption keys, and disabling unused device ports. An SOP for the network team can include a switch configuration standard and a router configuration standard as part of the equipment installation. NIST <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_728"></span>also recommends using network segmentation to segregate a network either physically with a dedicated network and hardware or logically with VLANs for security purposes. Therefore, higher-risk and critical areas like data center networks, finance networks, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks end up working on their own networks. Network segmentation creates different zones for these networks for ease of management, control, and auditing.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Role separation, sometimes known as separation of duties, is a practice of separating tasks and assigning them to different responsible groups or employees, therefore limiting full control of services or information and eliminating conflicts of interest. Role separation can be thought of as a check-and-balance process. For example, a network administrator should not be the same person who performs a network compliance audit.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Asset management or inventory management is another best practice. The basic principle is to protect the organization’s IT assets and prevent the misuse and loss of assets by establishing a self-inventory that can be used in the audit process. IT assets can include both hardware and software. Inventory management goes from the procurement stage to the assignment stage and then to the disposal stage. It is good to know when an asset was purchased, who was the responsible person, where the asset was located, and when it was disposed. Good inventory management can be much more than tracking assets; it can help predict the system life cycle, which is a factor in IT and budgetary planning.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another best practice is to consider an IT audit. An audit is an assessment of an organization’s IT infrastructure and security controls. An audit can be performed by internal auditors and external auditors. An audit and assessment report can help validate and verify an organization’s IT operations and practices. Today, many IT audits by third-party companies are also offered with cybersecurity posture assessment, which provides a way to assess the security status and health of an organization’s IT infrastructure.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section examines business continuity and disaster recovery, which is a critical step for any networking organization. This section examines key concepts such as high availability, MTBF, MTTF, and MTTR.</p>
        <p class="noindent">According to ISO 22301 2019, which is a standard for business continuity management systems, business continuity is a corporate capability. This capability exists whenever organizations can continue to deliver their products and services at acceptable predefined levels after disruptive incidents have occurred. Business continuity is a goal of any business.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Business continuity and disaster recovery go hand-in-hand in building resiliency in business operations. A business continuity plan identifies the key products and services of an organization and describes strategies to enable those key assets to stay operational. A disaster recovery plan outlines the process or procedures to recover the services quickly and effectively from after expected and unexpected disruptions in times of crisis. A number of metrics can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the business continuity and disaster recovery plans:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">

        <p class="noindent">Making backups is a best practice for data protection. Every business must protect its valuable data. Backing up company data is one of the most important functions in IT operations; it is a key for data loss prevention and disaster recovery. Traditionally, companies have backed up their data to a local backup server and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_730"></span>then made a copy to a medium like tape. Today, data can be backed up to a cloud location to help eliminate single points of failure. There are many types of backups, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Full backup:</strong> This is the most complete type of backup, where all data is copied to a designated backup location or medium. A full backup can take a long time, depending on the size of the source. It also can take up a large amount of storage space if archives need to be kept.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Differential backup:</strong> This type of backup includes all data that has changed since the last full backup. The first differential backup copy is a full backup, and the subsequent backups are the differences from the previous full backup copy. Differential backups take less time and less storage space than do full backups.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Incremental backup:</strong> This type of backup includes only data that has changed since the previous backup copy. The first incremental backup copy is a full backup, and subsequent backups are the differences from the previous copies. This type of backup generally takes the least time and the least storage space.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">High availability (<a id="ch13key29" href="glossary.xhtml#glo240"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>HA</strong></span></a>) is a critical concept for business continuity and disaster recovery. It refers to information technology systems being in continuous operation for a long time, with minimal downtime. Typical high availability systems include hospitals and data centers, which are intended to be in operation 100% of the time. HA eliminates single points of failure by adding high redundancy. It also provides fault tolerance, which enables the ability to failover to a redundant system when a service fails. When there is a failure—whether it is a hardware failure, network failure, or software failure—HA systems must be able to detect failures and to fail over to the redundant system. An HA reliable/redundant system might make it so that failures are not seen, but failures must be noted in the maintenance log.</p>
        <div class="box">

        <p class="box-para">High availability, a critical concept for business continuity and disaster recovery that refers to information technology systems being in continuous operation for a long time, with minimal downtimes</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Examples of HA technologies are load balancing, Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), First Hop Redundancy Protocol (<a id="ch13key30" href="glossary.xhtml#glo206"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>FHRP</strong></span></a>), active–active firewall appliances, and VMware vSphere HA.</p>

        <p class="box-para">First Hop Redundancy Protocol provides default gateway redundancy. In the event of a router failure, there’s a backup router that continues to forward traffic for user</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">The concept of high availability is important to organizations that use the Internet. Most organizations seek to have multiple Internet connections. Having multiple ISPs and having diverse network paths for critical infrastructure are network best practices for high availability and redundancy.</p>
        <p class="noindent">High availability deployments also have been widely deployed in power management. Power loss creates a big disruption in business continuity. HA applied to power management might require supplying electrical power from two or more different sources or separate feeds from the electrical company, sometimes known as <em>redundant circuits</em>. Also to create power redundancy, a system can be connected to a backup power source such as a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) or battery <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_731"></span>backup. That way, when power is lost, the system is automatically switched over to the backup system. There may be a need to have power generators to generate electrical power in the case of extended power outage. For individual pieces of equipment, having dual power supplies, where each connects to a different power distribution unit (<a id="ch13key31" href="glossary.xhtml#glo450"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>PDU</strong></span></a>), is an easy and practical approach to HA in the event of the loss of one power source.</p>

        <p class="box-para">Power Distribution Unit</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">In addition to HA, an organization needs to plan for a disaster recovery site where the mission-critical systems can be housed to bring the organization back up and running if a disaster puts the current data center out of commission. A disaster recovery site must be an offsite facility. Also, different types of disaster recovery sites lend themselves to different disaster recovery or backup setups or architectures:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch13key32" href="glossary.xhtml#glo19"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Active/passive</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> In this architecture, a disaster recovery site is idle, in standby mode. It becomes a primary active site only when it is needed. This setup may require some downtime to bring the standby site up to take over for the primary site.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch13key33" href="glossary.xhtml#glo18"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Active/active</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> In this architecture, the primary site and the disaster recovery site are both up and running at the same time. The data can be synchronized between the two sites. Also, load balancing could be deployed to balance the load between the two sites. This strategy is more complex than the active/<br>passive one.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Active/Passive</p>
        <p class="box-para">An architecture in which the disaster recovery site is idle, in standby mode</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">There are a few types of disaster recovery sites:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Cold site:</strong> A <a id="ch13key34" href="glossary.xhtml#glo110"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>cold site</strong></span></a> is an empty facility with only power and cooling but no equipment or racks. This type of site can only be used in an active/passive strategy.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Warm site:</strong> A <a id="ch13key35" href="glossary.xhtml#glo675"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>warm site</strong></span></a> is a not-yet-operational facility with power, cooling, and rack space; the equipment is onsite but not racked or powered up. This type of site can only be used for active/passive strategy.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Hot site:</strong> A <a id="ch13key36" href="glossary.xhtml#glo254"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>hot site</strong></span></a> is a full-blown operational facility with power, cooling, and equipment racked and powered up and connected to the network. It is a duplicate of the current data center. This type of site can be used for both active/active and active/passive strategies.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Cloud site:</strong> A <a id="ch13key37" href="glossary.xhtml#glo108"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>cloud site</strong></span></a> is an offsite cloud storage or disaster recovery service provided by a cloud provider. This type of service can be managed by the client or can be completely managed by the third-party cloud provider. This solution offers an organization the advantage of not having to deal with the backup system and the facility. This type of site can be used for both active/active and active/passive strategies.</p></li>
