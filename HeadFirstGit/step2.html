Perhaps you have been assigned a new feature, and while you are working on it, your manager asks you to fix a bug in production. Or maybe you just got around to putting the finishing touches on your latest change, but inspiration has struck and you’ve just thought of a better way of implementing it. Branches allow you to work on multiple, completely disconnected pieces of work on the same codebase at the same time, independently of one another. Let’s see how!</p>

        <p>Norm failed to account for the fact that Git commits build on previous commits. When Norm made the commit for the bug fix, it was <em>after</em> he had committed his partially done work. This meant that the bug fix commit was derived from a commit that included incomplete work!</p>

He could then fix the bug, commit the fix, and go back and reapply all of his previous work, hoping he doesn’t miss anything. Seems painful, right?</p>
        <p>At this point you are probably wondering if Git will come riding along and save the day. It will! Git allows you to “switch tracks” using a feature called <em>branches</em>. Branches allow you to keep your changes completely independent of one another.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Git allows multiple developers to contribute to the same project, also using branches. But that’s a topic for another chapter.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>One way to think about your commit history is to visualize your commits as buds on a tree branch. When you work on any branch, the commits are sequential, appearing one after the other.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0054-01.png" alt="Image" width="350" height="166">
        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>However, tree branches can fork off and grow in parallel. So can Git branches. What this means is that you can work on different things simultaneously without accidentally including things that you did not intend to (like Norm did).</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0054-02.png" alt="Image" width="392" height="309">

        </div></figure>
        <p>A commit represents a point in time, and a branch represents a series of commits. Recall that a series of commits is also the commit history. So branches are different commit histories, all in the same repository! At any point you can choose to create a new branch, switch between branches, discard a branch (that is, decide to abandon all the work you put into it), and even merge branches.</p>

        <p>It turns out that when you initialize a new Git repository and make your first commit, you are already working with branches! Git by default uses a branch called <code><strong>master</strong></code>, which explains why <code>git status</code> reported that you were on that branch.</p>
        <p>So far, in the newly created <code>80s-diner</code> repository, you only have one commit. As long as you do not create another branch, every subsequent commit you make will be on this branch.</p>
        <p>We’ll just say it right here—<em>you are going to be using branches a lot when working with Git</em>. Although initially it may seem like more trouble than it’s worth, you will soon see that creating, managing, and eventually integrating your work between branches is painless in Git. Not to mention that it gives you a ton of freedom as you work.</p>

        <p>There is nothing special about the default branch or the name <code>master</code>. This branch is no different from any branch that you can create. You can rename it if you choose, and in fact many teams do. If you were to go back and read the hints that <code>git init</code> provided on the previous page, you’ll notice that Git provides you not only a way to change the name of <code>master</code> to something else, it tells you how to permanantly set the name of the default branch for any repository that you might create going forward.</p>
        <p>However, Git still defaults to <code>master</code>, and to avoid confusion, we are going to continue using the name <code>master</code> for the default branch throughout this book.</p>

You can use the <code>branch</code> command to create a new branch, list all the branches in your repository, and even delete branches. And, like everything you have done so far, all this happens in the terminal inside your working directory.</p>
        <p>Let’s start by creating a new branch. You can use the <code>branch</code> command, giving it the name of the branch you wish to create as an argument.</p>

        <p>The output of the <code>git branch</code> command is a list of all the branches in the current repository. Git helpfully puts an asterisk next to the branch that we are currently using.</p>
        <p>Creating a new branch does not mean you can start to use it immediately. You have to switch to it first.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I have whitespaces in my branch name?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> No. If you want a multi-word branch name, use hyphens or underscores. If you attempt to put a space in your branch name, Git will report an “<code>is not a valid name</code>” error. Forward slashes (<code>/</code>) are allowed, though!</p>
        <p>We’ll talk more about branch names at the end of this book, so stay tuned for that.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What happens if I try to create a branch with a name that already exists?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Just like with an invalid branch name, Git will error out, telling you that a branch with that name already exists. It’s good to get in the habit of running <code>git branch</code> to list all the branches in your repository prior to creating a new one.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: How many branches can I have in my Git repository?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> As many as you like! But as we will see soon, usually you will use a branch to work on a small, isolated change, then merge that into an “integration” branch when you are done, and then delete the branch. We’ll dive into integration branches and deleting branches soon. This helps you keep a nice tidy repository.</p>

        <p><strong>git switch is a relatively new command.</strong></p>
        <p><em>If you get an error like</em> “<code>switch is not a git command</code>”, <em>be sure to check the version of Git you have installed with</em> <code>git version</code>. <em>You need to have a version greater than</em> <code>2.23.0</code>.</p>
        <p><em>Older versions of Git used the</em> <code>git checkout</code> <em>command to switch branches. While that still works, we prefer to show you the latest (and now correct) way to do things</em>.</p>

        <p>If you like performing remarkable feats at the command line, then you’ll be happy to know that the <code>git switch</code> command lets you create a new branch and switch to it in one fell swoop. You can invoke the <code>git switch</code> command with the <code>-c</code> (or -<code>-create</code>) flag, giving it the name of the branch you wish to create, like so:</p>
        <p><code>git switch -c my-first-branch</code></p>
        <p>This will prompt Git to create the branch called <code>my-first-branch</code> and switch to it immediately. However, since this is your first foray into Git, we’ll continue using the <code>git branch</code> command to create new branches for the remainder of this book.</p>

        <p><strong>Great question!</strong> It might not look like it right now, but branches offer you a ton of flexibility as you start to work with multiple requirements.</p>
        <p>Right now, you have two branches: <code>master</code> and <code>add-fall-menu</code>. You initialized the repository, which put you on the <code>master</code> branch. You added and committed the existing menu on the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
        <p>When you got the requirements for the fall menu, you chose to do all that work on a separate branch: namely the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch.</p>
        <p>These two branches represent two completely separate requirements. Remember, branches allow you to isolate parts of the work from one another. If tomorrow management were to come around and ask that you work on something totally unrelated (and most assuredly they will!), you simply create a new branch from <code>master</code> and get to work. All the work you did on the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch remains undisturbed till you get a chance to get back to it.</p>
        <p>The good news here is that working on a branch is not new to you—you’ve been working with branches all along! Other than having to create and switch branches, your workflow remains the same—you add or edit files, you add them to the index, and then you commit them.</p>

        <p>At this point we had one commit on the <code>master</code> branch.

        <p>So far, we’ve only committed the <code>menu.md</code> file. Since both the <code>master</code> and the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch point to the same commit, they both know about the same <code>menu.md</code> file.</p>

        <p>Since the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch started with the commit that included the <code>menu.md</code> file and then introduced the <code>fall-menu.md</code> file, it now has both files in it.

        <p><strong>Guinevere:</strong> Wait, is this a new menu?</p>
        <p><strong>Maddie:</strong> Yep. We’ve decided to make a special menu for Thursday nights. The theme is ’80s movies, so it stays on brand, and we are calling it...wait for it...Throwback Thursdays!</p>
        <p><strong>Guinevere:</strong> OK...but we are still in the middle of finishing up the fall menu.</p>
        <p><strong>Armando:</strong> It’s fine, Guinevere. I’ll create a new file in our repository, work in the new menu, and commit it.</p>
        <p><strong>Guinevere:</strong> Whoa! Hold on. If you commit now, you’ll commit it on the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch. We want to keep these changes independent of one another. Here, let me show you what will happen if you commit right now:</p>

        <p><strong>Armando:</strong> Then I’ll just use the <code>branch</code> command to create a new branch. That should do the trick, right?</p>
        <p><strong>Guinevere:</strong> Well, we want to be sure we don’t include any of the fall menu changes. We’re currently on the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch. If you create a new branch, it’ll be based on the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch. We want the new branch to be based on the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

So what makes a branch a branch? Let’s start with the role of a commit—a commit is a snapshot of the content you staged (that is, the files you added to the index). If you happen to be working on a task in which you have made two or more commits, then the commits are “strung” together. That is, every subsequent commit records the ID of the commit that came just before it.</p>

        <p>Imagine you have a separate note for every branch in your repository. Every note has the name of the branch and the ID of the last commit on that branch. When you make a commit on a branch, Git first creates the commit. It then takes the “sticky note” representing that branch, erases the commit ID that was on it, and scribbles in the new one:</p>

Well, all that hard work is about to pay off. You are about to understand what it means to switch branches.</p>
        <p>Remember, branches are just pointers to commits. And a commit is simply a snapshot of everything you added to the index, along with some metadata including the commit message you provided when you created the commit. In other words, the commit remembers the state of the index at the time you made the commit.</p>
        <p>Let’s return to the commit graph you created for the ’80s Diner. We have annotated it for you, showing you the files that you will find in each branch:</p>

        </div></figure>
        <p>As you can see, every time you switch branches, you are potentially switching commits (unless the two branches in question point to the same commit). And a commit records the state of the index when you made the commit. Which means...</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Every time you switch branches, Git rewrites your working directory to look like it did when you made the most recent commit on the branch you just switched to.</strong></p>

That begs the question—<em>which</em> branch should everything live on?</p>
        <p>Recall that when you initialize a new Git repository, you always start with a branch called <code>master</code>. Since this branch is created by default, it’s always there! So many teams simply use the <code>master</code> branch as the branch that will hold the main storyline of their project.</p>
        <p>This is often referred to as an “integration” branch—in that this is where you bring together all the different tasks you worked on in other branches.</p>
        <p>Choosing <code>master</code> is often just a matter of convenience. You can choose to make <strong>any</strong> branch the integration branch. As long as you and your colleagues agree, it’s all good.</p>
        <p>While you are choosing branch names, you might as well choose a good name. One popular option is “main” instead of <code>master</code>.</p>
        <p>So integration branches are where things come together. What does that make everything else? Other branches are often referred to as “feature” branches—essentially branches that serve to introduce one thing. These branches would serve to add a new feature, or fix a bug, or add and improve documentation. Essentially, they are one and done—for every separate task, there would be a different feature branch.</p>

Remember, what makes a integration branch special is just convention; any branch can be made an integration branch that serves as the place where everything—big and small, features and bug fixes—comes together.</p>
        <p>Bringing the work that was done in separate branches together is called <strong><em>merging</em></strong>, and Git has a command specifically built in to do just that: <code>merge</code>. The <code>git merge</code> command allows you to combine the work done in different branches.</p>
        <p>Merging in Git typically involves two branches—the branch that you are on (we’ll refer to this as the “proposer”) and the branch you wish to merge or “mix” in (we’ll call this the “proposee”).</p>
        <p>Since we are so food obsessed, we are going to double down on it! Think about baking a cake. You can start preparing the icing as the cake has to cool after coming out of the oven. At some point, you want to “merge” the two together. Here, the cake would be the proposer, and the icing would be the proposee.</p>
        <p>Let’s continue with that analogy (oh yeah—we are doubling down on it!): let’s say you had two branches in your repository—<code>bake-cake</code> and <code>prepare-icing</code>.</p>

The good news is that you don’t have to remember every nuance of every Git command (and there are a <strong>lot</strong> of commands)—you can simply ask Git to help you out. If you are the kind of person who reads technical documentation for leisure, then you want to run “<code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code>”—for example, <code>git branch --help</code>. This is the whole enchilada: everything you ever need to know about the branch command is listed here, including examples of usage! This is a page you’ll want to come back to once you get some hands-on experience with Git.</p>

        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">You can also use “git help &lt;command&gt;”, which is an alias for “git &lt;command&gt; --help”.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>If you are in a hurry, or just a CliffsNotes kinda person, then the version you want is “<code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code>” like so: <code>git branch -h</code>. This is a much shorter version of the help page. Of course, if something catches your eye but you don’t understand what it does or how to use it, you can always use the longer version (<code>--help</code>) to get more details.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Here is your memory trick of the day: “--help” has more characters in it than “-h”, just as the --help page has more characters and details than the -h page.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>Git by default uses a “pager” when displaying long outputs, you know, like help pages. A <em>pager</em> is simply a program that only displays one page of text at a time. You can use your cursor keys to navigate up and down the page one line at a time. Once you are done, hit the letter “q,” which stands for “quit,” and your terminal will be restored back to the prompt.</p>

They love the new dishes you conjured up and are gearing up for the launch night. Seems like you are done with your work on that feature. So now what?</p>
        <p>We’ll be sticking to the standard convention of using the <code>master</code> branch as the integration branch. That means that all work needs to be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. So let’s do just that.</p>
        <p>Back in the terminal, <code>cd</code> into the <code>80s-diner</code> directory. First, a sanity check to make sure you are in a good place: <code>git status</code>.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Since <code>master</code> branch is the integration branch, you should merge the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch <em>into</em> the <code>master</code> branch. You will have to first switch to the <code>master</code> branch, and then merge the <code>add-fall-menu branch</code> into it.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        </div></figure>
        <p>Now, if you were to list all the files that are part of the <code>master</code> branch, you will see the <code>master</code> branch has two files: <code>menu.md</code> and <code>fall-menu.md</code>! That is, the <code>master</code> branch reflects the work that was done in the two branches separately.</p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> You are absolutely right to ask that question. There are two separate issues here.</p>
        <p>First, consider the intent—if the <code>master</code> branch is the integration branch, then everything should get merged <em>into</em> the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
        <p>Second, merging means bringing together multiple different lines of work, which has an effect on the commit history of your project. <em>What</em> gets merged into what has deep implications on how the merge will happen, and what the final result will look like. Yes, that sounds nebulous—so we are going to be spending a lot of time in this chapter talking about exactly that. More in a few pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: OK, so you are telling me that the work we did in the</strong> <code>add-fall-menu</code> <strong>branch is now merged into the</strong> <code>master</code> <strong>branch. So what happens to the</strong> <code>add-fall-menu</code> <strong>branch?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> For now, you can let it be. If you get another request to make additional changes to the fall menu, you would create a <strong>new</strong> branch based on <code>master</code>, make your changes, and when done simply merge back into <code>master</code>.</p>
        <p>The answer to your question lies in deleting branches, which we will discuss at the end of this chapter.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I got a</strong> <code>merge: not something we can merge</code> <strong>error. Help!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you get the name of the branch right! We highly recommend listing all your branches and copy-pasting the name to avoid such mistakes.</p>

You might have also noticed the “fast-forward” that appeared in your terminal output when you performed the merge between the <code>master</code> and the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch. So what did Git actually do?</p>
        <p>Let’s start with the commit history, focusing only on <code>master</code> and <code>add-fall-menu</code>. For simplicity we’ll use letters in alphabetical order to represent the commit IDs. It looks something like this.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0079-01.png" alt="Image" width="495" height="368">
        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>In this scenario, we have two sticky notes to represent the two branches, each one pointing to the latest commit on that branch. The thing to notice here is that the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch is based on the latest commit on the <code>master</code> branch. The <code>master</code> branch has not changed (no new commits on it) since the inception of the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch. In other words, the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch has everything the <code>master</code> branch does! Which means, for Git to make <code>master</code> (the proposer) look like <code>add-fall-menu</code>, Git could simply move <code>master</code> to the same commit as the last commit on the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch.</p>
        <p>That is exactly what Git does. Git rewrites the <code>master</code> sticky note to point to the same commit that the <code>add-fall-menu</code> sticky note points to. This is referred to as a “fast-forward” merge—where a branch, in this case <code>master</code>, simply jumps forward.</p>

        <p>When merging, the fast-forward merge is the best-case scenario, since technically it’s not a merge at all. It’s simply one branch “catching up” with another.</p>
        <p>Look back and study the commit IDs you listed on the previous page. Notice that the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch and the <code>master</code> branch both point to the same commit after the merge.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="merging" data-secondary="order of" id="idm45426363870992"></a>Let’s think of a hypothetical—what if, instead of merging into the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch into <code>master</code>, we attempted to merge <code>master</code> into the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch? Turns out, while this may not be obvious, it <strong><em>absolutely</em></strong> matters how we perform the merge.</p>
        <p>First, a recap of what the setup would look like. This time around, <code>add-fall-menu</code> is the proposer and <code>master</code> is the proposee. So we would start by switching to <code>add-fall-menu</code>, then merge the <code>master</code> branch into <code>add-fall-menu</code>.</p>
        <p>Here is how this would play out:</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Womp womp. Not quite what you expected, huh? To understand what transpired here, we go back to the commit history. This is what the commit history looked like before we merged <code>add-fall-menu</code> into <code>master</code>.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0080-03.png" alt="Image" width="600" height="152">
        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Merging <code>master</code> into <code>add-fall-menu</code> is just another way saying “Hey Git, <code>add-fall-menu</code> should be the combination of <code>add-fall-menu</code> and <code>master</code>.” Well, <code>add-fall-menu</code> is based on <code>master</code>, which means it already <em>has</em> everything that <code>master</code> has to offer.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Remember, master has no new commits on it since we created add-fall-menu branch.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>So Git tells us that <code>add-fall-menu</code> is “Already up to date.” Which is to say, <code>add-fall-menu</code> is already the combination of <code>add-fall-menu</code> and <code>master</code>. To put it in terms of the commit history, nothing changed since there was nothing to do.</p>
        <p>Logically, the “direction” of the merge always results in two files (<code>menu.md</code> and <code>add-fall-menu.md</code>) being present in the working directory. Remember—the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch, being based on <code>master</code>, already has the <code>menu.md</code> file in it because it started with it! But the order of the merge has a huge impact on your commit history, as we just saw. In one case, <code>master</code> fast-forwarded to the commit that <code>add-fall-menu</code> points to; in the other case, nothing changed.</p>

You might recall that we, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#beginning_gitcolon_get_going_with_git">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>, configured our name and email address, which is recorded in every commit <em>we</em> make. However, there are times when it’s <em>Git</em> that needs to make a commit (we will see this scenario over the next few pages). But in order to do so, Git needs a commit message. So far it’s just been you creating commits, and every time you did so, you supplied a commit message using the <code>-m</code> flag supplied to the <code>commit</code> command. However, if Git ever needs to create a commit, Git will present you with a text editor to type your commit message in. The question is—what editor should it use?</p>
        <p>Git is configured to use a default editor, which is Vim. If you are familiar with using Vim, feel free to skip this page and go on to the next one. However, if you want to change to an editor you are more familiar with, then keep reading.</p>
        <p>In the introduction of this book we recommended you install Visual Studio Code. If you <em>are</em> using Visual Studio Code, then fire up your terminal and run this little nugget of code.</p>

        </div></figure>
        <p>Of course, you don’t have to use Visual Studio Code. Feel free to stick to your editor of choice: Notepad++, Emacs, Sublime Text, or whatever tickles your fancy. Since there are too many to list here, we encourage you to fire up your favorite search engine and look for “how do I set up &lt;insert text editor name here&gt; as my Git editor”. The only thing that should change is the argument you supply in place of “<code>code -w</code>”.</p>

        <p>Everything we have done so far, including creating commits and branches and merging branches together, has involved interacting with the commit history. New commits are chained together with their parent commits on the same branch; branches are sticky notes that point to commits; and merges serve to bring two branches (two separate commit histories) together.</p>
        <p>Truly, Git enlightenment lies in understanding the commit history!</p>
        <p>Furthermore, almost every subject we touch upon in this book will revolve around this graph.</p>
        <p>There are a slew of graphical user interface (GUI) tools that let you work with Git. So far we have only used the Git command-line tools, but once you are far enough in your journey with Git, you might start to use GUI tools too. And guess what? They all show you the same commit history graph! You are just ahead of the class in that regard. Now aren’t you glad you bought this book?</p>

The ’80s Diner has never seen so much foot traffic, and business is booming. Management wants to capitalize on all the buzz by starting Throwback Thursdays <em>now</em>.</p>
        <p>We’ve decided to use the <code>master</code> branch as the integration branch. Now that the Thursday menu has gotten the sign-off, we are going to merge the <code>add-thurs-menu</code> branch into the <code>master</code> branch. But before you start, remember—the <code>add-thurs-menu</code> branch was created off the <code>master</code> branch. Merging the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch into <code>master</code> resulted in a fast-forward merge—in other words, <code>master</code> simply moved forward to the latest commit on <code>add-fall-menu</code>.</p>

This is where it’s important to realize that whenever you branch, you are actually creating a branch that points to a <strong>commit</strong>, not to another branch. Branches, being simple pointers to commits, offer an easy way to get to commits. Remember, the “basis” for the branch is <em>always</em> a commit.</p>

        </div></figure>
        <p>Notice that both the <code>master</code> branch and the <code>add-thurs-menu</code> branch share a common ancestor (in this case, the commit with ID “A”). When we merge the two branches together, we are attempting to combine the work done <strong><em>after</em></strong> that commit.</p>

        <p>This particular scenario is a great example of branches diverging from one another after starting at a common point in time.

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If you got an error like “<code>error: Empty commit message</code>”, then it means that you might have accidentally cleared out all the text in your merge editor window and then closed it. This supplies an empty message, and Git errors out. Git will inform you what to do, but the easiest way is to type <code>git commit</code> and hit Enter in the console window. This will bring up your editor once again. This time, type in your message, save the file, then close it. You should be good to go now.</p>

Is this merge any different from our last merge? If it is, why? We have never seen an editor pop up to ask for a commit message before, so what’s different now?</p>
        <p>Let’s go back to our color mixing analogy. (You did do that Brain Power exercise, right?) When you mix yellow into orange, you end up with orange. That’s because orange already contains yellow. This, in Git world, would be analogous to a fast-forward merge. This is what we saw when we merged <code>add-fall-menu</code> into <code>master</code>.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Well, technically you end up with a lighter orange, but then again, every analogy eventually breaks.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>But what if you attempt to mix two primary colors like red and blue? Well, you get a whole <strong>new</strong> color: purple!</p>
        <p>What’s this got to do with our latest merge exercise? Recall that before we merged <code>add-thurs-menu</code> and <code>master</code>, <code>master</code> had diverged away from <code>add-thurs-menu</code> because <code>master</code> had moved (fast-forwarded) to the commit that the <code>add-fall-menu</code> pointed to. When we try to merge <code>add-thurs-menu</code> into <code>master</code>, Git has to reconcile two <em>different</em> sets of changes into one. So Git pulls a fast one—it creates a <strong>new</strong> commit for us that represents the combined work from both branches. Here is what your commit history looks like before and after the merge:</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0087-01.png" alt="Image" width="389" height="420">

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Notice that <code>master</code> moves to point to the latest commit, identified by “E.” This is expected—the <code>master</code> sticky note is updated to reflect the new commit on that branch, while <code>add-thurs-menu</code> stays put. This is called a <strong>merge commit</strong>, and it is comprised of all the changes that were introduced in the two separate branches.</p>
        <p>However, every commit that we make in Git needs a commit message that describes what that commit contains. We usually do this explicitly with the “-m” flag. Since we did not supply Git with a commit message when we performed the merge, Git pops up our editor to give us a place to do just that!</p>

        <p>Another hypothetical commit history for your viewing pleasure. To elaborate upon how we got here:</p>

        <li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/star.png" alt="Image" width="11" height="11"></span> We then <code>switch</code>-ed back to the <code>add-chat</code> branch and made another commit, <code>E</code>.</p></li>

        <p>Now, we will attempt to merge the <code>add-emojis</code> branch into the <code>add-chat</code> branch.

It records the work that resulted from bringing two branches together, along with some metadata. The metadata includes your name and email, the time when the commit was created, and the commit message you supplied when we performed the merge. Also, every commit (other than the very first one in a repository) records the ID of the commit that preceded it.</p>
        <p>However, merge commits have a few interesting characteristics. For one thing, remember that you did not create this commit explicitly—rather, Git did, when it merged two branches that had diverged away from one another.</p>
        <p>For another thing, a merge commit has <em>two</em> parents—the <strong>first</strong> parent is the last commit on the branch that is the proposer, and the <strong>second</strong> parent is the last commit from the proposee branch that was merged in. Looking back at the <code>80s-diner</code> commit history:</p>

        <p>The most important aspect of merge commits is their effect on your commit history. So far, you have seen how branches diverge from one another. This is apparent when you draw the commit history. Merge commits are the other side of the same coin—they present a point in your commit history where diverged branches come together.</p>

In one universe, you might be a humanitarian, intent on solving all human suffering. In another, you are a villain, laser-focused on world domination. Now suppose these two universes come crashing into one another. What happens? There can only be one of you—so which one will it be? The humanitarian or the villain? Or could you somehow be both?</p>
        <p>In the ’80s Diner repository, so far we have not needed to work with the same file in multiple branches. We had three branches, all of which introduced new files. But what if all three branches worked with the same file, modifying it in different ways? Perhaps you edited a file in one branch, and then edited the exact <strong>same line</strong> in the <strong>same file</strong> in another branch. That is, in one branch the file looks different than the same file in another branch.</p>
        <p>Consider a repository with two branches—<code>master</code> and <code>feat-a</code>. The <code>master</code> branch has one commit on it, which introduces the <code>notice.md</code> file (commit <code>A</code>), which only has one line of text in it. We then create the <code>feat-a</code> branch, switch to it, edit the file, and make commit <code>B</code>. Finally, we switch back to the <code>master</code> branch, edit the file <em>again</em>, and make one final commit, <code>C</code>.</p>

        <p>Git <code>merge</code> fails immediately, but it tries to be helpful by telling you which files have a merge conflict.</p>
        <p>Git <code>status</code>, much like the <code>merge</code> command, also tells us that Git could not complete the merge for some files, and it lists them. It also tells us to fix the conflicts and then run the <code>git commit</code> command.</p>
        <p>It might be confusing when Git says “both modified”—this means that <strong><em>both</em></strong> branches modified the same file.</p>

        <p>Of course, you may not be always be able to pick both changes, particularly if the final result is not syntactically valid.

        <p><strong>Sounds improbable, right?</strong> Turns out, not so much. Most projects comprise dozens, if not hundreds, of files. It’s not unusual to work on multiple tasks at the same time. And you might end up inadvertently touching the same file in two separate branches. When you get to merging those separate branches together, there is a potential for conflict.</p>
        <p>The other scenario is when multiple people start to use Git as a collaboration tool. We haven’t gotten to talking about that just yet, but it involves different people working on different branches. When two different people, working on two different tasks in two different branches in the same repository, affect the same file, they’re likely to create a merge conflict.</p>
        <p>Merge conflicts occur more than you think, so get comfortable with them. But don’t you worry—the next exercise will make you an expert in conflict resolution.</p>

You create a branch, start your work, commit when necessary, and when you are ready, merge back into the integration branch.</p>
        <p>But after a while, you have all these branches sitting around in your Git repository, so it’s time for a cleanup. Git allows you to delete branches, using the <code>git branch</code> command. First things first: <strong>you can’t delete the branch that you are on</strong>! So if you happen to be on the branch you are about to delete, you need to switch to another branch.</p>
        <p>Take this hypothetical repository as an example. It has two branches, <code>master</code> being the integration branch, and a feature branch, called <code>feat-home-screen</code>. <code>feat-home-screen</code> was just merged into <code>master</code>, so we can safely delete it.</p>

        <p>Git always attempts to be as helpful as possible. This time it not only tells you that it deleted the branch but follows it up with the commit ID of the last commit on that branch. This is very useful in case you accidentally delete the wrong branch. If you suddenly realize you deleted the wrong branch, you can use a variation of the <code>git branch</code> command that lets you supply it the commit ID the branch should be based on, like so: <code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt; &lt;base-commit-id&gt;</code>. This will allow you to undo an accidental delete.</p>

        <h5>there are no Dumb Questions</h5>
        <p><strong>Q: It seems that I can delete my branch as soon as I am done integrating my work. Should I wait a little bit longer?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Nope! You got it right the first time. Once you merge your branch into the integration branch, there is no reason to keep that branch around. Go ahead! Delete it.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I got an error when deleting my branch.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> If you got an error that looks like <code>error: branch not found</code>, then you either misspelled the name of the branch or are trying to delete a branch that you’ve already deleted. You can use <code>git branch</code> to list all your branches, verify that the branch exists, and make sure you get the name right.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Why do I need to delete these branches? Why not just keep ’em around?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Branches are used to work on a single thing, away from other tasks you might have in flight. Think of them as single-use containers like a coffee cup from a drive-through—once you get your caffeine fix, you simply toss away the container.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you don’t delete branches you no longer need, your <code>git branch</code> list gets longer and longer over time, and it gets harder to figure out which branches are “active” and which ones have been merged and are no longer needed. And who doesn’t like a nice clean repository?</p>

Suppose you worked on a feature branch called <code>feat-a</code>, which you just merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Take a moment to think about what your commit history looks like after you finish merging:</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0098-02.png" alt="Image" width="417" height="246">
        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>When you delete the <code>feat-a</code> branch, all Git does is to throw away the sticky note that represents the <code>feat-a</code> branch. As for commit “B”: notice that the merge commit “D” has two parents, “C” and “B,” <strong><em>and</em></strong> the <code>master</code> branch sticky note points to commit “D.” So “B” sticks around because your commit history needs it. (Remember, it acts as the second parent of commit “D.”)</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0098-03.png" alt="Image" width="510" height="131">
        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>The thing to remember is that as long as a commit is “reachable”—that is, there is a reference to it (like a branch) or another commit pointing to it as a parent—it will stay in your commit history. In this case, the <code>master</code> branch points to commit “D,” and “D” points to “B.” So commit “B” stays. You can extend this logic to “A” as well—because it has two commits referencing it—“B” and “C.”</p>

Which is, if the branch you are deleting has been merged, then your commit history does not change! Only the sticky note that represents the branch disappears. But what if you try to delete a branch that hasn’t been merged yet? Let’s look at another hypothetical commit history where we have two branches, <code>master</code> and <code>feat-b</code>, but we haven’t merged them together yet.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Notice that there is a commit “B” on the <code>feat-b</code> branch. Now, if we tried to delete the <code>feat-b</code> branch, this is what you’d see:</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Git notices that if you were to delete the <code>feat-b</code> branch, commit “B” would not be reachable. In other words, there is nothing (a sticky note, or another commit) referencing it. And so it refuses to!</p>
        <p>Now there is a chance that you created a branch just to try out an idea or approach a problem using a different tack, and you don’t care for it anymore. You can supply the branch command with the <code>-D</code> (yep, uppercase D) flag to force its deletion.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Git will display the ID of the latest commit of the branch that you force deleted, so you can always recover it like we showed you a few pages ago.</span></p>

Here are a few of the practices that many developers adhere to when branching and merging:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Typically, base your new branches on commits on integration branches.</strong></p>
        <p>Integration branches reflect the work of all branches. This means that your new branch will have everything that has been completed so far, so you can work knowing that you have a good starting point.</p>

        </div></figure></li>
        <li><p><strong>Merge back into the integration branch once you are done.</strong></p>
        <p>It’s tempting to delay merging back into the integration branch, but once you think you are done with the task at hand, then merge. If you miss something, you can always create another branch based on the integration branch (which will now reflect the changes you merged earlier).</p>

        <p>A typical workflow involves creating a new branch, getting your work done, merging into the integration branch, and then deleting the feature branch. Again, remember, you can always create a new branch if you need to.</p>

        <h5>there are no Dumb Questions</h5>
        <p><strong>Q: How do I know when to create a new branch, and when to merge it?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Typically, create a new branch for any new “task.” Let’s say you are assigned a ticket to add a new feature, or fix a bug—that’s your sign to create a new branch. Once your work meets the “definition of done” in the ticket, you should merge your work into the integration branch.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I don’t get it. Why shouldn’t I reuse branches?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> When you start work on a new task, you always want the freshest set of changes in that project, which is always reflected in the integration branch. Branches, on the other hand, can get “stale.”</p>
        <p>Secondly, branches are cheap in Git. They are simply references to commits in the directed acyclic graph. Use them, and once done with the task at hand, delete them!</p>

Branches allow you to work on multiple tasks at the same time.</p></li>
        <li><p>When working in Git, you are <em>always</em> working on a branch. Every repository starts with a branch and defaults to the name <code>master</code>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <code>master</code> branch is not special in any way. It’s no different than any other branch you create. You can rename or even delete the <code>master</code> branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>The primary command to work with branches is <code>git branch</code>. You can use <code>git branch</code> to create, list, and delete branches.</p></li>
        <li><p>To create a branch called <code>update-profile</code>, supply the name to <code>git branch</code> like so: <code>git branch update-profile</code></p></li>
        <li><p><code>git branch</code> allows you to create branches, but to start using the new branch, use the <code>git switch</code> command. Supply it with the name of the branch you wish to start using, like so: <code>git switch update-profile</code></p></li>
        <li><p>Think of a branch as a sticky note that contains the branch name and the commit ID of the last commit on that branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>Every time you make a commit on a branch, Git updates the sticky note that represents that branch, giving it the new commit ID. This is how a branch “moves.”</p></li>
        <li><p>Since branches always point to commits, they offer an easy way to create other branches.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whenever you <code>switch</code> branches, Git rewrites the working directory to reflect the state captured in the latest commit on that branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a typical workflow, some branches (by convention) are treated as “integration” branches to collect the work done in other branches.</p></li>
        <li><p>In contrast, day-to-day work is done in “feature” branches. Each feature branch is to be used for one thing and one thing only: for example, to introduce a new feature, or fix a bug.</p></li>
        <li><p>To combine the work you’ve done in an integration branch, you <em>merge</em> the feature branch <em>into</em> the integration branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>The easiest kind of merge is called a “fast-forward merge,” in which one branch simply “catches up” with another branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>The other kind of merge is when you merge two branches that have <em>diverged</em> from one another, in which case Git will create a merge commit.</p></li>
        <li><p>A merge commit is like any other commit, except it’s created by Git and has not one but two parents—the first parent is the latest commit on the integration branch, and the second parent is the latest commit on the feature branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>Occasionally, the same line in the same file has been modified in the two branches being merged, causing a merge conflict. Git relies on you to resolve the merge conflict.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can delete a branch using the <code>git branch</code> command, along with the <code>-d</code> (or <code>--delete</code>) flag.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you attempt to delete a branch that has not been merged yet, Git will error out. If you are absolutely sure you want to delete an unmerged branch, you’ll have to use the <code>-D</code> (uppercase “D”) flag with the <code>git branch</code> command.</p></li>
        <li><p>A branch is always based on a commit. If you know the ID of the commit you want to use as the basis for a branch, you can supply it to the <code>git branch</code> command:</p>
        <p><code>git branch branch-name commit-ID</code></p></li>

        <p>Oh dear! To help our fellow developers we had carefully laid out all the commands needed to list all the branches in their (existing) repository, then create a new branch, switch to it, and check to make sure that all is well. Alas! The magnets fell on the floor. It’s your job to put them back together. Be careful; a few extra magnets got mixed in, and some get used more than once.</p>

        <p>In the <code>80s-diner</code> directory, go ahead and run <code>git branch --help</code> (or <code>git help branch</code>—use either one), and find the section regarding the <code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code> flag. <strong>Read up on what it does</strong><code>.</code></p>
        <p>Next, run <code>git branch -v</code> and record the branch name and the latest commit ID here. (You are going to need these for the next few sections in this chapter.)</p>

        <p>Let’s flex our command-line skills a bit more. You are going to repeat our previous exercise of listing the latest commit IDs on each branch. Recall that you can use <code>git branch -v</code> and see information about each of your branches. Go ahead and do that again:</p>

        <p>Compare these with the ones you did the last time around. What changed?</p>

        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Since we merged add-fall-menu and master, they point to the same commit. add-thurs-menu remains unchanged.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, list the files in each branch. Start with the <code>master</code> branch, then <code>switch</code> to the <code>add-fall-menu</code> branch and finally the <code>add-thurs-menu</code> branch, using <code>ls</code> to list the files you see in each branch:</p>

        <p>Another hypothetical commit history for your viewing pleasure. To elaborate upon how we got here:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/star.png" alt="Image" width="11" height="11"></span> We started by making commit <code>A</code> on the <code>master</code> branch.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/star.png" alt="Image" width="11" height="11"></span> We then created the <code>add-chat</code> branch and made another commit, <code>B</code>.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/star.png" alt="Image" width="11" height="11"></span> We created the <code>add-emojis</code> branch based on commit <code>B</code> and proceeded to make two more commits on that branch, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/star.png" alt="Image" width="11" height="11"></span> We then <code>switch</code>-ed back to the <code>add-chat</code> branch and made another commit, <code>E</code>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is what the commit graph looks like:</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>Now, we will attempt to merge the <code>add-emojis</code> branch into the <code>add-chat</code> branch. In other words, the <code>add-chat</code> branch is the proposer, and <code>add-emojis</code> is the proposee. Will this result in a fast-forward merge, or will this form a merge commit?</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Looking at the commit graph, we see that both add-chat and add-emojis share a common commit (B), but they have diverged from one another (since they both have commits since B). So this will result in a merge commit.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, draw the resulting commit graph here.</p>
