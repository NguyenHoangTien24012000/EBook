        <h1>Preface</h1>
        
        
        <p>Microservices<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="benefits of" id="idm45699548484304"></a> are an approach to distributed systems that promote the use of finely grained services that can be changed, deployed, and released independently. For organizations that are moving toward more loosely coupled systems, with autonomous teams delivering user-facing functionality, microservices work incredibly well. Beyond this, microservices provide us with a huge number of options for building out systems, giving us a lot of flexibility to ensure our system can change to meet the needs of the users.</p>
        
        <p>Microservices aren’t without significant downsides, though. As a distributed system, they bring a host of complexity, much of which may be new even to experienced developers.</p>
        
        <p>The experiences of people all over the world, along with the emergence of new technologies, are having a profound effect on how microservices are used. This book brings these ideas together, along with concrete, real-world examples, to help you understand whether microservices are right for you.</p>

        <h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>
        
        <p>The<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="target audience" id="idm45699546814624"></a> scope of <em>Building Microservices</em> is broad, as the implications of microservice architectures are also broad. As such, this book should appeal to people interested in aspects of design, development, deployment, testing, and maintenance of systems. Those of you who have already embarked on the journey toward finer-grained architectures, whether for a greenfield application or as part of decomposing an existing, more monolithic system, will find plenty of practical advice to help you. This book will also help those of you who want to know what all the fuss is about, so that you can determine whether microservices are right for you.</p>

        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why I Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45699547519168">
        <h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>
        
        <p>At one level, I wrote this book because I wanted to make sure that the information in the first edition remained up to date, accurate, and useful. I wrote the first edition because there were really interesting ideas that I wanted to share. I was fortunate that I was in a place where I had the time and support to write the first edition, and that I could do so from a fairly unbiased viewpoint because I didn’t work for a big technology vendor. I wasn’t selling a solution, and I hoped I wasn’t <em>selling</em> microservices either—I just found the ideas fascinating, and I loved unpacking the concept of microservices and finding ways of sharing it more broadly.</p>
        
        <p>When I really break it down, I wrote a second edition for two main reasons. Firstly, I felt I could do a better job this time. I’ve learned more, and I am hopefully a bit better as a writer. But I also wrote this second edition because I played a small part in helping these ideas hit the mainstream, and as such I have a duty of care to make sure they are presented in a sensible, balanced way. Microservices have become, for many, the default architectural choice. This is something that I think is hard to justify, and I wanted a chance to share why.</p>
        
        <p>This book isn’t <em>pro</em> microservices, nor is it <em>anti</em> microservices. I just want to make sure that I’ve properly explored the context in which these ideas work well and shared the problems they can cause.</p>
        </div></section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What’s Changed Since the First Edition?"><div class="sect1" id="idm45699546806336">
        <h1>What’s Changed Since the First Edition?</h1>
        
        <p>I wrote the first edition of <em>Building Microservices</em> in around a year, starting at the beginning of 2014, with the book being released in February 2015. This was early in the microservices story, at least in terms of the wider industry’s awareness of the term. Since then, microservices have gone mainstream in a way that I couldn’t have predicted. With that growth has come a much wider set of experiences to draw on, and more technology to explore.</p>
        
        <p>As I worked with more teams in the wake of the first edition, I started to refine my thinking around some of the ideas associated with microservices. In some cases, this meant that ideas that were only at the periphery of my thinking, like information hiding, started to become more clear as foundational concepts that needed to be better highlighted. In other areas, new technology presented both new solutions and new problems for our systems. Seeing so many people flock to Kubernetes in the hope that it would solve all their issues with microservice architectures certainly gave me pause for thought.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, I’d written the first edition of <em>Building Microservices</em> to provide not just an explanation of microservices, but also a broad overview of how this architectural approach changes aspects of software development. So as I looked more deeply at aspects around security and resiliency, I found myself wanting to go back and expand on those topics that are increasingly important to modern software development.</p>
        
        <p>Thus in this second edition, I spend more time sharing explicit examples to better explain the ideas. Every chapter has been reexamined, and every sentence reviewed. Not a lot of the first edition remains in terms of concrete prose, but the ideas are all still here. I’ve tried to be clearer in my own opinions, while still recognizing that there are often multiple ways of solving a problem. This has meant expanding the discussion of inter-process communication, which is now split across three chapters. I also spend more time looking at the implications of technologies such as containers, Kubernetes, and serverless; as a result, there are now separate build and deployment chapters.</p>
        
        <p>My hope had been to create a book around the same size as the first edition, while finding a way to pack in more ideas. As you can see, I’ve failed to achieve my goal—this edition is bigger! But I think I’ve succeeded in being clearer in how I articulate the ideas.</p>

        <h1>Navigating This Book</h1>
        
        <p>This<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="approach to learning" id="MSlearn00"></a> book is primarily organized in a topic-based format. I have structured and written the book as though you will read it from beginning to end, but of course you may want to jump to the specific topics that most interest you. If you do decide to dive right into a specific chapter, you may find the <a data-type="xref" href="glossary01.html#glossary">Glossary</a> toward the end of the book helpful in explaining new or unfamiliar terms. On the topic of terminology, I use microservice and service interchangeably throughout the book; you can assume that the two terms refer to the same thing unless I explicitly state otherwise. I also summarize some of the book’s key advice in the <a data-type="xref" href="afterword02.html#bibliography">Bibliography</a> if you <em>really</em> just want to jump to the end—just remember you’ll be missing a <em>lot</em> of detail if you do that!</p>
        
        <p>The main body of the book is broken into three separate parts—Foundation, Implementation, and People. Let’s look at what each part covers.</p>

        <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
        
        <p>I am continually amazed by the support I get from my family, especially that of my wife, Lindy Stephens, who puts up with so much with amazing good grace. To say this book wouldn’t exist without her is an understatement, even if she doesn’t always believe me when I tell her that. This is for her. It’s also for my dad, Jack, Josie, Kane, and the wider Gilmanco Staynes clan.</p>
        
        <p>Much of this book was written during a global pandemic, which as I write these acknowledgments is still ongoing. It may not mean much, but I want to extend my thanks to the NHS here in the UK, and to all the people worldwide who are keeping us safe by working on vaccines, treating the sick, delivering our food, and helping in a thousand other ways I wouldn’t understand. This is also for all of you.</p>
        
        <p>This second edition wouldn’t exist without the first, so I’d like to reiterate my thanks to everyone who helped me during the challenging process of writing my first book, include the technical reviewers Ben Christensen, Martin Fowler, and Venkat Subramaniam; James Lewis for our many enlightening conversations; the O’Reilly team of Brian MacDonald, Rachel Monaghan, Kristen Brown, and Betsy Waliszewski; and excellent review feedback from readers Anand Krishnaswamy, Kent McNeil, Charles Haynes, Chris Ford, Aidy Lewis, Will Thames, Jon Eaves, Rolf Russell, Badrinath Janakiraman, Daniel Bryant, Ian Robinson, Jim Webber, Stewart Gleadow, Evan Bottcher, Eric Sword, and Olivia Leonard. And thank to Mike Loukides, I guess, for getting me into this mess in the first place!</p>
        
        <p>For the second edition, Martin Fowler once again returned as technical reviewer and was joined by Daniel Bryant and Sarah Wells, who were generous with their time and feedback. I’d also like to thank Nicky Wrightson and Alexander von Zitzerwitz for helping push the technical review over the finishing line. On the O’Reilly front, the whole process was overseen by my awesome editor, Nicole Taché, without whom I would certainly have gone insane; Melissa Duffield, who seems to do a better job of managing my workload than I do; Deb Baker, Arthur Johnson, and the rest of the production team (I’m sorry I don’t know all your names, but thank you!); and Mary Treseler, for steering the ship through some difficult times.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, the second edition has benefited hugely from help and insights from a number of people, including (in no particular order) Dave Coombes and the team at Tyro, Dave Halsey and the team at Money Supermarket, Tom Kerkhove, Erik Doernenburg, Graham Tackley, Kent Beck, Kevlin Henney, Laura Bell, Adrian Mouat, Sarah Taraporewalla, Uwe Friedrichse, Liz Fong-Jones, Kane Stephens, Gilmanco Staynes, Adam Tornhill, Venkat Subramaniam, Susanne Kaiser, Jan Schaumann, Grady Booch, Pini Reznik, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, Manuel Pais, Matthew Skelton, and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Finally, I’d like to thank the awesome readers of the early access version of the book, who provided invaluable 
        <span class="keep-together">feedback</span>; they include Felipe de Morais, Mark Gardner, David Lauzon, Assam Zafar, Michael Bleterman, Nicola Musatti, Eleonora Lester, Felipe de Morais, Nathan DiMauro, Daniel Lemke, Soner Eker, Ripple Shah, Joel Lim, and Himanshu Pant. And finally, hello to Jason Isaacs.</p>
        
        <p>I wrote the bulk of this book throughout the whole of 2020 and in the first half of 2021. I used Visual Studio Code on macOS for most of the writing, although on rare occasions I also used Working Copy on iOS. OmniGraffle was used to create all the diagrams in the book. AsciiDoc was used to format the book and on the whole was excellent, with O’Reilly’s Atlas toolchain doing the magic of making a book appear on the other side.</p>
