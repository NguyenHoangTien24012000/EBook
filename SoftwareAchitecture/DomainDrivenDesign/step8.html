        <h1><span class="label">Chapter 8. </span>Event Storming</h1>
        <p>Event storming is a fun and easy-to-facilitate modeling workshop that brings together the core aspects of DDD that we spoke about in the preceding chapters. </p>
        <p>The goals of the workshop are to provide a framework for exploring business domains, gather knowledge, and lay the foundations for a ubiquitous language.</p>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Participate in Event Storming?"><div class="sect1" id="who_should_participate_in_event_storming">
          <h1>Who Should Participate in Event Storming?</h1>
          <p>Ideally, a diverse group of people should participate in the workshop. Anyone related to the business domain in question can participate in event storming: that includes engineers, domain experts, product owners, testers, UI/UX designers, support personnel, etc. The more people with differing backgrounds are involved, the more knowledge will be discovered.</p>
          <p>Take care not to make the group too big, however. Every participant should be able to contribute to the process, but this can be challenging for groups of more than 10 participants.</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What Do You Need for Event Storming?"><div class="sect1" id="what_do_you_need_for_event_storming">
          <h1>What Do You Need for Event Storming?</h1>
          <p>Event storming is considered a low-tech workshop because it is done using a pen and paper (a lot of papers, actually). Let’s see what you need for facilitating an event storming session.</p>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Modeling Space"><div class="sect2" id="modeling_space">
            <h2>Modeling Space</h2>
            <p>First, you need a large modeling space. A whole wall covered with butcher paper makes the best modeling space, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_31_modeling_space_for_event_storming">Figure&nbsp;8-1</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="fig_31_modeling_space_for_event_storming" class="figure">

              <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-1. </span>Modeling space for event storming</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>A large whiteboard can fit the purpose as well, but it has to be as big as possible—you will need all the modeling space you can get.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Stickies"><div class="sect2" id="stickies_idyoLQHe">
            <h2>Stickies</h2>
            <p>Next, you need lots of stickies of different colors. The stickies will be used to represent different concepts of the business domain, and every participant should be able to add them freely, so make sure you have enough colors and enough for everyone. </p>
            <p>The colors that are traditionally used for event storming are described in the next section. It’s best to stick to these conventions if at all possible.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Markers"><div class="sect2" id="markers_idzQog7w">
            <h2>Markers</h2>
            <p>You’ll also need markers that are comfortable to write on the stickies with. Again, stationery shouldn’t be a bottleneck for knowledge sharing—there should be enough markers for all participants.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Snacks"><div class="sect2" id="snacks_idQwNLWI">
            <h2>Snacks</h2>
            <p>A typical event storming session lasts about 2–4 hours, so bring some healthy snacks for energy replenishment. </p>

          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Room"><div class="sect2" id="room_idAReZKI">
            <h2>Room</h2>
            <p>Finally, you need a spacious room. Make sure there isn’t a huge table in the middle that will prevent participants from moving freely and observing the modeling space.</p>
            <p>Also, chairs are a big no-no for event storming sessions. You want people to participate and share knowledge, not sit in a corner and zone out. Therefore, if possible, take the chairs out of the room.</p>

        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The Event Storming Process"><div class="sect1" id="the_event_storming_process">
          <h1>The Event Storming Process</h1>
          <p>An event storming workshop is usually conducted in seven steps. During each step, the model is enriched with additional information and concepts.</p>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 1: Unstructured Exploration"><div class="sect2" id="step_1_unstructured_exploration">
            <h2>Step 1: Unstructured Exploration</h2>
            <p>Event storming starts with a brainstorm of the domain events related to the business domain being explored. A domain event is something interesting that has happened in the business. It’s important to formulate domain events in the past tense (see <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_32_domain_events">Figure&nbsp;8-2</a>)—they are describing things that have already happened. </p>
            <figure><div id="fig_32_domain_events" class="figure">
              <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492057802/files/assets/widd_0802.png" alt="Domain events" width="831" height="171">
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-2. </span>Domain events</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>During this step, all participants are grabbing a bunch of orange stickies, writing down whatever domain events come to mind, and sticking them to the modeling surface.</p>
            <p>At this early stage, there is no need to worry about ordering events, or even about redundancy. This step is all about brainstorming the possible things that can happen in the business domain.</p>
            <p>The group should continue generating domain events until the rate of adding new ones significantly slows down.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 2: Timelines"><div class="sect2" id="step_2_timelines">
            <h2>Step 2: Timelines</h2>
            <p>Next, the participants go over the generated domain events and try to organize them chronologically—in the order those events occur in the business domain.</p>
            <p>The ordering of the events should start with the “happy path scenario”: the flow that describes a successful business scenario.</p>
            <p>Once the “happy path” is done, alternative scenarios can be added—for example, paths where errors are encountered or different business decisions are taken. The flow branching can be expressed as two flows coming from the preceding event, or with arrows drawn on the modeling surface, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_33_flows_of_events">Figure&nbsp;8-3</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="fig_33_flows_of_events" class="figure">
              <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492057802/files/assets/widd_0803.png" alt="Flows of events" width="1428" height="379">
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-3. </span>Flows of events</h6>
            </div></figure>
            <p>This step is also the time to fix incorrect events, remove duplicates, and of course add missing events if any are discovered.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 3: Commands"><div class="sect2" id="step_3_commands">
            <h2>Step 3: Commands</h2>
            <p>Whereas a domain event describes something that has already happened, a command describes what triggered the event or flow of events. Commands describe the system’s operations and, contrary to domain events, are formulated in the imperative. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Publish campaign</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Roll back transaction</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Submit order</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Commands are written on light blue stickies and are placed on the board before the events that can be produced by them. If a particular command is executed by an actor in a specific role, the actor information is added to the command on a small yellow sticky, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_34_a_command_and_its_resulting_domain_events">Figure&nbsp;8-4</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="fig_34_a_command_and_its_resulting_domain_events" class="figure">
              <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492057802/files/assets/widd_0804.png" alt="A command and its resulting domain events" width="789" height="268">
              <h6><span class="label">Figure 8-4. </span>A command and its resulting domain events</h6>
            </div></figure>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 4: Policies"><div class="sect2" id="step_4_policies">
            <h2>Step 4: Policies</h2>
            <p>Almost always, there are commands that are added to the model but have no specific actor associated with them. During this step, you look for automation policies that might execute those commands.</p>
            <p>An automation policy is a scenario when the execution of a command is triggered by an event. In other words, a command is automatically executed when a specific domain event happens.</p>
            <p>On the modeling surface policies are represented as purple stickies connecting events to commands, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_35_an_automation_policy_that_triggers_the_ship_order">Figure&nbsp;8-5</a>.</p>
            <figure><div id="fig_35_an_automation_policy_that_triggers_the_ship_order" class="figure">

            </div></figure>
            <p>If the events and commands are far apart, an arrow can be drawn on the modeling surface to connect them.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 5: External Systems"><div class="sect2" id="step_5_external_systems">
            <h2>Step 5: External Systems</h2>
            <p>The fifth step is about augmenting the model with external systems. An external system is defined as any system that is not a part of the domain being explored. It can execute commands (input) or can be notified about events (output).</p>
            <p>The external systems are represented by pink stickies (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig_36_an_external_system_used_both_as_an_input_and_as_an">Figure&nbsp;8-6</a>).</p>
            <figure><div id="fig_36_an_external_system_used_both_as_an_input_and_as_an" class="figure">

            </div></figure>
            <p>By the end of this step, all commands should either be executed by actors, triggered by policies, or called by external systems.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Step 6: Aggregates"><div class="sect2" id="step_6_aggregates">
            <h2>Step 6: Aggregates</h2>
            <p>Once all the events and commands are represented, the participants can start thinking about organizing related concepts in aggregates. An aggregate receives commands and produces events.</p>
            <p>Aggregates are represented as large yellow stickies, with commands on the left and events on the right (<a data-type="xref" href="#commands_and_domain_events_organized">Figure&nbsp;8-7</a>).</p>

            <h2>Step 7: Bounded Contexts</h2>
            <p>The last step of an event storming session is to look for aggregates that are related to each other, either because they represent closely related functionality or because they’re coupled through policies. The groups of aggregates form natural candidates for bounded contexts’ boundaries, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_37_a_possible_decomposition_of_the_system_into_bounde">Figure&nbsp;8-8</a>.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>At the end of the event storming session, you will have a model describing the business domain’s events, commands, aggregates, and even possible bounded contexts. However, all of these are just nice bonuses. The real value of an event storming session is the process itself—the sharing of knowledge between different stakeholders, alignment of their mental models of the business, discovery of conflicting models, and, last but not least, formulation of the ubiquitous language.</p>
