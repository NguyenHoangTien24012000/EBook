        <h1><span class="label">Chapter 6. </span>Architectural Patterns</h1>
        <p>Which architectural pattern to use is a crucial tactical design decision. The right pattern will support the implementation of the system’s functional and nonfunctional requirements.</p>
        <p>In this chapter, we will take a look at three architectural patterns and their use cases: the layered architecture, ports &amp; adapters, and CQRS patterns.</p>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Layered Architecture"><div class="sect1" id="layered_architecture">
          <h1>Layered Architecture</h1>
          <p>The layered architecture pattern organizes the system’s code around the following three technical concerns:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Presentation layer</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Presents/defines the user interface</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Business logic layer</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Implements the business logic</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Data access layer</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Provides access to persistence mechanisms (databases and other infrastructural components)</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>The layers reference each other in one direction only, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_25_layered_architecture">Figure&nbsp;6-1</a>.</p>

          <p>As you can see from the diagram, the presentation layer depends on the business logic layer, and the business logic layer depends on the data access layer.</p>

            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <p>The dependency between the business logic and the data access layers makes this architectural pattern a good fit for a system with its business logic implemented using the active record pattern (the patterns mentioned here were all introduced in the previous chapter).</p>
          </div></section>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Ports &amp; Adapters"><div class="sect1" id="ports_adapters">
          <h1>Ports &amp; Adapters</h1>
          <p>The ports &amp; adapters architecture is similar to the layered architecture in that it also decomposes the system’s codebase based on technological concerns. However, it is also different in many aspects:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Terminology</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The ports &amp; adapters architecture refers to the system’s user interface, its data access code, and all other infrastructural concerns simply as the “infrastructure layer.”</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Dependencies</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Instead of being sandwiched between the technological concerns, in the ports &amp; adapters architecture, business logic takes the central role. It doesn’t directly depend on any of the system’s infrastructural components.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Application layer</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The application layer implements a façade for the system’s public interface. It describes all the operations exposed by the system and orchestrates the system’s business logic for executing them. This is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_26_ports_adapters_architecture">Figure&nbsp;6-2</a>.</p>

            <h2>Integration of Infrastructural Components</h2>
            <p>The core goal of the ports &amp; adapters architecture is to decouple the system’s business logic from its infrastructural components. </p>
            <p>Instead of referencing and calling the infrastructural components directly, the business logic layer defines “ports” that have to be implemented by the infrastructure layer. The infrastructure layer implements “adapters”: concrete implementations of the ports’ interfaces for working with different technologies. The application layer supplies the adapters for the business logic’s ports through dependency injection.</p>
            <p>For example, here is a possible port definition, and a concrete adapter, for a message bus:</p>
            <div data-type="example">
  <pre data-type="programlisting">public interface IMessaging {
    void Publish(Message payload);
    void Subscribe(Message type, Action callback);

          <h1>Command-Query Responsibility Segregation</h1>
          <p>Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that allows the representation of data in multiple persistent models. Let’s see why we might need such a solution and how to implement it.</p>

            <h2>Polyglot Modeling</h2>
            <p>In many cases, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to model the system’s business in a way that would address all of the system’s needs. For example, different models are optimal for implementing online transaction processing (OLTP), online analytical processing (OLAP), and search. </p>
            <p>Another reason for working with multiple models may be the notion of polyglot persistence, which applies when no single database can support all of the system’s needs. Instead, it would be beneficial to use multiple databases to implement different data access requirements. For example, a single system might use a document store as its operational database, a column store for analytics/reporting, and a search engine for implementing robust search capabilities.</p>
            <p>Let’s see how CQRS allows the use of multiple storage mechanisms for representing different models of the system’s data.</p>

            <p>For the read models to work, the system has to project changes from the command execution model to all its read models. This concept is illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_27_cqrs_architecture">Figure&nbsp;6-3</a>.</p>

            <p>Let’s take a look at two ways of generating projections: synchronous and asynchronous.</p>
            <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Synchronous projections"><div class="sect3" id="synchronous_projections">
              <h3>Synchronous projections</h3>
              <p>Synchronous projections fetch changes to the OLTP data through the catch-up subscription model:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>The projection engine queries the OLTP database for records that were added or updated after the last processed checkpoint.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The projection engine uses the updated data to regenerate/update the system’s read models.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The projection engine stores the checkpoint of the last processed record. This value will be used during the next iteration for getting records added or modified after the last processed record.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>This process is illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_28_synchronous_projection_of_read_models_through_catc">Figure&nbsp;6-4</a>.</p>
              <figure><div id="fig_28_synchronous_projection_of_read_models_through_catc" class="figure">

              </div></figure>
              <p>For the catch-up subscription to work, the command execution model has to checkpoint all the appended or updated records. The storage mechanism should also support the querying of the records based on the checkpoint.</p>
              <p>The checkpoint can be implemented as a timestamp column in relational databases, or using a custom solution that increments a running counter and appends it to each modified record.</p>
              <p>The synchronous projection method makes it trivial to add new projections, as well as to regenerate existing ones from scratch. In the latter case, all you have to do is reset the checkpoint to 0; the projection engine will scan the records and rebuild the projections from the ground up.</p>
            </div></section>
            <section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Asynchronous projections"><div class="sect3" id="asynchronous_projections">
              <h3>Asynchronous projections</h3>
              <p>In the asynchronous projection scenario, the command execution model publishes all committed changes to a message bus. The system’s projection engines can subscribe to the published messages and use them to project the read models, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_29_asynchronous_projection_of_read_models">Figure&nbsp;6-5</a>.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Despite the obvious scaling and performance advantages of the asynchronous projection method, it is more prone to the challenges of distributed computing. If the messages are processed out of order or duplicated, inconsistent data will be projected into the read <span class="keep-together">models.</span></p>
            <p>This method also makes it more challenging to add new projections, or to regenerate existing ones.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, it’s advisable to always implement synchronous projection, and optionally an additional asynchronous projection on top of it.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Model Segregation"><div class="sect2" id="model_segregation">
            <h2>Model Segregation</h2>
            <p>In the CQRS architecture, the system’s models’ responsibilities are segregated according to their type. A command can only operate on the strongly consistent command execution model. A query cannot directly modify any of the system’s state—neither the read models nor the command execution model.</p>
            <p>A common misconception about CQRS-based systems is that a command can only modify data, and data can be fetched for display only through a read model. This approach produces accidental complexities and leads to a bad user experience. A command can return data, as long as it originates from the command execution model.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Use Cases"><div class="sect2" id="use_cases_idN75cZp">
            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <p>The CQRS pattern can be useful for applications that need to work with the same data in multiple models. </p>
            <p>Moreover, CQRS naturally lends itself to event-sourced domain models. The event sourcing model makes it impossible to query records based on the aggregates’ states, but CQRS enables this by projecting the states into queryable databases.</p>

          <h1 class="less_space">Conclusion</h1>
          <p>The layered architecture decomposes the codebase based on its technological concerns. Since this pattern couples the business logic with the data access implementation, it’s a good fit for active record–based systems.</p>
          <p>The ports &amp; adapters architecture inverses the relationships: it puts the business logic at the center and decouples it from all infrastructural dependencies. This pattern is a good fit for business logic implemented with the domain model pattern.</p>
          <p>The CQRS pattern represents the same data in multiple models. Although this pattern is obligatory for event-sourced domain model–based systems, it can also be used in any systems that need a way of working with multiple persistent models.</p>
