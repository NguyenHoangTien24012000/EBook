        <h1><span class="label">Chapter 10. </span>Getting Started with <span class="keep-together">Domain-Driven Design</span></h1>
        <p>This report has introduced domain-driven design’s tools for analyzing business domains, sharing knowledge, and making strategic and tactical design decisions. At first, it might seem overwhelming to come to grips with all these concepts, let alone to implement them in practice. The good thing is that it’s not all or nothing—you don’t have to apply all of DDD’s patterns and practices to gain value from it. This is especially true for brownfield projects, where it’s practically impossible to introduce all the patterns and practices in a reasonable time frame.</p>
        <p>In this final chapter, we will look at a number of tips and tricks for gradually incorporating domain-driven design into your projects.</p>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Ubiquitous Language"><div class="sect1" id="ubiquitous_language_10">
          <h1>Ubiquitous Language</h1>
          <p>The use of a ubiquitous language is the cornerstone practice of domain-driven design. It is essential for domain knowledge discovery and sharing, and for effective solution modeling.</p>
          <p>Luckily, you don’t need a corporate strategy to use a ubiquitous language. This practice is so trivial, it’s borderline common sense. Therefore, appeal to common sense. Listen carefully to the language used by the stakeholders when they speak about the business domain. Gently steer the terminology away from technical jargon toward its business meaning. </p>
          <p>Look for inconsistent terms, and ask for clarifications. For example, if there are multiple names for the same thing, look for the reason. Are those different models intertwined in the same solution? Look for contexts and make them explicit. If, on the other hand, the meaning is the same, follow common sense and ask for one term to be used.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, communicate with domain experts as much as possible. These efforts shouldn’t necessarily be formal meetings. Water coolers and coffee breaks are great communication facilitators. Speak with the domain experts about the business domain. Try using their language. Look for difficulties in understanding, and ask for clarifications. Don’t worry—domain experts are usually happy to collaborate with engineers that are sincerely interested in learning about the problem domain!</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Business Domain"><div class="sect1" id="business_domain">
          <h1>Business Domain</h1>
          <p>As Jesse Watson said in his excellent article <a href="https://oreil.ly/YYEg9">“The Hard Thing About Software Development”</a>: “The most valuable asset in the software industry is the synthesis of programming skill and deep context in the business problem domain, in one skull.” Cultivating a ubiquitous language and analyzing the company’s business domain is a shortcut to acquiring that deep context in the problem domain.</p>
          <p>Investigate what your company is doing. What service(s) does it provide for its customers? What differentiates it from the competition, and what things are all companies in its industry doing in the same way?</p>
          <p>Once you recognize the core, supporting, and generic subdomains, see how they are implemented. Does the solution fit the complexity of the problem? Are there areas where more elaborate design patterns are needed? Conversely, are there any subdomains where it’s possible to cut corners or to use existing off-the-shelf solutions? Use this information to make smarter strategic and tactical decisions.</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Context Map"><div class="sect1" id="context_map_10">
          <h1>Context Map</h1>
          <p>Analyze the existing, even if implicit, bounded contexts and the interaction patterns between them. See how the teams working on different bounded contexts communicate and collaborate with each other. Especially when they are communicating through ad hoc or with shared kernel–like integration, do the teams have shared goals and adequate collaboration levels?</p>
          <p>Pay attention to problems that can be addressed by the context integration patterns:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Anticorruption layer</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Awkward models spreading from services and legacy systems</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Open-host service</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Customers having to catch up with changes in services they are consuming continually</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Separate ways</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Solutions that aren’t business-critical, but are too hard to integrate between teams</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Finally, chart a context map for a deeper strategic insight.</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Bounded Contexts"><div class="sect1" id="bounded_contexts_10">
          <h1>Bounded Contexts</h1>
          <p>Many companies put effort into decomposing their monolithic solutions into microservices. There are cases, however, in which such a goal is overreaching and hard to accomplish.</p>
          <p>To mitigate risks, it can make a lot of sense to fix the monolith first. Begin by dividing it into bounded contexts. Look for conflicting models. Identify the implicit boundaries and make them explicit. The boundaries can be logical at first—namespaces or modules—and later be refactored into different physical solutions and <span class="keep-together">codebases.</span></p>
          <p>Finally, when refactoring legacy systems, don’t forget to protect the new codebase from old models. Use the open-host service and anticorruption layer patterns.</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Event Storming"><div class="sect1" id="event_storming_10">
          <h1>Event Storming</h1>
          <p>Another thing you don’t need a corporate strategy for is event storming. Facilitate as many of those workshops as possible: use event storming for exploring new requirements and building a ubiquitous language with the domain experts, and for exploring legacy codebases. Those undocumented messes that no one truly <span class="keep-together">understands</span> are nevertheless generating profits for the business; gather everyone related to them and explore their business domains. Event storming is a fantastic tool for recovering domain knowledge.</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Tactical Patterns"><div class="sect1" id="tactical_patterns">
          <h1>Tactical Patterns</h1>
          <p>Refactoring a legacy codebase into a domain model or an event-sourced domain model is not easy. But again, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing.</p>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Value Objects"><div class="sect2" id="value_objects">
            <h2>Value Objects</h2>
            <p>Start by looking for possible value objects. Immutable objects can greatly reduce the solution’s complexity, even if you are not using a full-blown domain model.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Transaction Boundaries"><div class="sect2" id="transaction_boundaries">
            <h2>Transaction Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Analyze the transactional boundaries. Are there decisions that require strong consistency, but operate on eventually consistent data? Or conversely, does the solution enforce strong consistency where eventual consistency would suffice? When analyzing the codebase, don’t forget that these decisions are driven by business, not technological, concerns.</p>
          </div></section>
          <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Event-Sourced Domain Model"><div class="sect2" id="event_sourced_domain_model_10">
            <h2>Event-Sourced Domain Model</h2>
            <p>When the solution calls for an event-sourced domain model, implementation of this pattern might be hard to sell. Despite its many advantages, it sounds too radical for many people. The solution, as with everything we’ve discussed in this report, is for the business domain to drive this decision.</p>
            <p>Talk to domain experts. Show them the state- and event-based models. Explain the differences and the advantages offered by event sourcing, especially with regard to the dimension of time. More often than not, they will be ecstatic with the level of insight it provides and will advocate event sourcing themselves.</p>
            <p>And while you’re interacting with the domain experts, don’t forget to work on the ubiquitous language!</p>
          </div></section>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Conclusion"><div class="sect1" id="conclusion_10">
          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>What I hope you take away from this report is the fact that domain-driven design is not all or nothing. You can incorporate its concepts individually to leverage a lot of value, especially in brownfield projects. Use the strategic design concepts to analyze existing codebases, and for making sound decisions on how to improve them.</p>
          <p>The tactical patterns can be introduced gradually, as well. Value objects can be used to simplify codebases, and transactional boundaries provided by aggregates are the key to implementing business rules.</p>
          <p>Finally, event storming is an indispensable tool for any project, green- or brownfield. Use it to explore new requirements, and to recover business domain knowledge about legacy codebases.</p>
          <p>Good luck!</p>
