        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="application containers" data-secondary="sidecar pattern" id="idm139824744425984"></a>The first is the <em>application container</em>. It contains the core logic for the application. Without this container, the application would not
        exist. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sidecar container" id="idm139824744424368"></a>In addition to the application container, there is a <em>sidecar container</em>. The role of the sidecar is to augment and improve
        the application container, often without the application container’s knowledge.  In its simplest form, a sidecar container can be used to add functionality to a container that might otherwise be difficult to improve. Sidecar containers are coscheduled onto the same machine via
        an atomic <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="container group" id="idm139824744422800"></a><em>container group</em>, such as the <code>pod</code> API object in Kubernetes. In addition to being scheduled on the same machine,
        the application container and sidecar container share a number of
        resources, including parts of the filesystem, hostname and network, and
        many other namespaces. A generic image of this sidecar pattern is
        shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig-sidecar-pattern">Figure&nbsp;2-1</a>.</p>

        <h1>An Example Sidecar: Adding HTTPS to a Legacy Service</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="HTTPS, adding to a legacy web service with sidecar patterns" id="idm139824744416896"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sidecar patterns" data-secondary="adding HTTPS to a legacy service" id="idm139824744416144"></a>Consider, for example, a legacy web service. Years ago, when it was built, internal network security was not as high a priority for the company, and thus, the application only services requests over unencrypted HTTP, not HTTPS. Due to recent security incidents, the company has mandated the use of HTTPS for all company websites. To compound the misery of the team sent to update this particular web service, the source code for this application was built with an old version of the company’s build system, which no longer functions. Containerizing this HTTP application is simple enough: the binary can run in a container with a version of an old Linux distribution on top of a more modern kernel being run by the team’s container orchestrator. However, the task of adding HTTPS to this application is significantly more challenging. The team is trying to decide between resurrecting the old build system versus porting the application’s source code to the new build system, when one of the team members suggests that they use the sidecar pattern to resolve the situation more easily.</p>
        
        <p>The application of the sidecar pattern to this situation is straightforward. The legacy web service is configured to serve exclusively on localhost (127.0.0.1), which means that only services that share the local network with the server will be able to access the service. Normally, this wouldn’t be a practical choice because it would mean that no one could access the web service. However, using the sidecar pattern, in addition to the legacy container, we will add an nginx sidecar container. This nginx container lives in the same network namespace as the legacy web application, so it can access the service that is running on localhost. At the same time, this nginx service can terminate HTTPS traffic on the external IP address of the pod and proxy that traffic to the legacy web application  (see <a data-type="xref" href="#fig-https-sidecar">Figure&nbsp;2-2</a>). Since this unencrypted traffic is only sent via the local loopback adapter inside the container group, the network security team is satisfied that the data is safe. Likewise, by using the sidecar pattern, the team has modernized a legacy application without having to figure out how to rebuild a new application to serve HTTPS.</p>

        <h1>Dynamic Configuration with Sidecars</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="configuration synchronization" id="idm139824744407920"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dynamic configuration" id="idm139824744407152"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sidecar patterns" data-secondary="dynamic configuration with" id="idm139824744406480"></a>Simply proxying traffic into an existing application is not the only use for a sidecar. Another common example is configuration synchronization. Many applications use a configuration file for parameterizing the application; this may be a raw text file or something more structured like XML, JSON, or YAML. Many pre-existing applications were written to assume that this file was present on the filesystem and read their configuration from there. However, in a cloud-native environment it is often quite useful to use an API for updating configuration. This allows you to do a dynamic push of configuration information via an API instead of manually logging in to every server and updating the configuration file using imperative commands. The desire for such an API is driven both by ease of use as well as the ability to add automation like rollback, which makes configuring (and reconfiguring) safer and easier.</p>
        
        <p>Similar to the case of HTTPS, new applications can be written with the expectation that configuration is a dynamic property that should be obtained using a cloud API, but adapting and updating an existing application can be significantly more challenging.  Fortunately, the sidecar pattern again can be used to provide new functionality that augments a legacy application without changing the existing application. For the sidecar pattern shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig-sidecar-dynamic">Figure&nbsp;2-3</a>, there again are two containers: the container that is the serving application and the container that is the configuration manager. The two containers are grouped together into a pod where they share a directory between themselves. This shared directory is where the configuration file is maintained.</p>
        
        <p>When the legacy application starts, it loads its configuration from the filesystem, as expected. When the configuration manager starts, it examines the configuration API and looks for differences between the local filesystem and the configuration stored in the API. If there are differences, the configuration manager downloads the new configuration to the local filesystem and signals to the legacy application that it should reconfigure itself with this new configuration. The actual mechanism for this notification varies by application. Some applications actually watch the configuration file for changes, while others respond to a SIGHUP signal. In extreme cases, the configuration manager may send a SIGKILL signal to abort the legacy application. Once aborted, the container orchestration system will restart the legacy application, at which point it will load its new configuration. As with adding HTTPS to an existing application, this pattern illustrates how the sidecar pattern can help adapt pre-existing applications to more cloud-native scenarios.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="application containers" data-secondary="with sidecar" id="idm139824744602240"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="containers" data-secondary="modular, with sidecars" id="idm139824744601264"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modular application containers" id="idm139824744600320"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sidecar patterns" data-secondary="modular application containers" id="idm139824744599632"></a>At this point, you might be forgiven if you thought that the sole
        reason for the sidecar pattern to exist was to adapt legacy
        applications where you no longer wanted to make modifications to the
        original source code. While this is a common use case for the pattern,
        there are many other motivations for designing things using
        sidecars. One of the other main advantages of using the sidecar pattern is
        modularity and reuse of the components used as sidecars.
        In deploying any real-world, reliable application, there is functionality
        that you need for debugging or other management of the application, such as giving a readout of all of the different processes using resources in the container, similar to the <code>top</code> command line
        tool.</p>
        
        <p>One approach to providing this introspection is to require that
        each developer implement an <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="topz sidecar" id="idm139824744596880"></a>HTTP <code>/topz</code> interface that provides a readout of resource usage. To make this easier, you might implement this webhook as a language-specific plugin that the developer could simply link into their application. But even if done this way, the developer would be forced to choose to link it in and your organization would be forced to implement the interface for every language it wants to support. Unless done with extreme rigor, this approach is bound to lead to variations among languages as well as a lack of support for the functionality when using new languages. Instead, this <code>topz</code> functionality can be deployed as a sidecar container that shares the process-id (PID) namespace with the application container. This <code>topz</code> container can introspect all running processes and provide a consistent user interface. Moreover, you can use the orchestration system to automatically add this container to all applications deployed via the orchestration system to ensure that there is a consistent set of tools available for all applications running in your infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, with any technical choice, there are trade-offs between this
        modular container-based pattern and rolling your own code into your
        application. The library-based approach is always going to be somewhat
        less tailored to the specifics of your application. This means that
        it may be less efficient in terms of size of performance, or that the API
        may require some adaptation to fit into your environment. I would
        compare these trade-offs to the difference between buying off-the-rack clothing versus bespoke fashion. The bespoke fashion will always
        fit you better, but it will take longer to arrive and cost more to
        acquire. As with clothes, for most of us it makes sense to buy the
        more general-purpose solution when it comes to coding. Of course, if your application demands
        extremes in terms of performance, you can always choose the handwritten
        solution.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Hands On: Deploying the topz Container"><div class="sect2" id="idm139824744592288">
        <h2>Hands On: Deploying the topz Container</h2>
        
        <p>To see the <code>topz</code> sidecar in action, you first need to deploy some
        other container to act as the application container. Choose an
        existing application that you are running and deploy it using Docker:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker"><code class="nv">$ </code>docker run -d &lt;my-app-image&gt;
        &lt;container-hash-value&gt;</pre>
        
        <p>After you run that image, you will receive the identifier for
        that specific container. It will look something like:
        <code>cccf82b85000…</code> If you don’t have it, you can always look it up
        using the <code>docker ps</code> command, which will show all currently running
        containers. Assuming you have stashed that value in an environment
        variable named <code>APP_ID</code>, you can then run the <code>topz</code> container
        in the same PID namespace using:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker"><code class="nv">$ </code>docker run --pid<code class="o">=</code>container:<code class="si">${</code><code class="nv">APP_ID</code><code class="si">}</code> <code class="se">\</code>
            -p 8080:8080 <code class="se">\</code>
            brendanburns/topz:db0fa58 <code class="se">\</code>
            /server --addr<code class="o">=</code>0.0.0.0:8080</pre>
        
        <p>This will launch the <code>topz</code> sidecar in the same PID namespace as the
        application container. Note that you may need to change the port that the
        sidecar uses for serving if your application container is also running
        on port <code>8080</code>.  Once the sidecar is running, you can visit <em><a href="http://localhost:8080/topz"><em class="hyperlink">http://localhost:8080/topz</em></a></em> to get a complete readout of the processes
        that are running in the application container and their resource usage.</p>
        
        <p>You can mix this sidecar with any other existing container to
        easily get a view into how the container is using its resources via
        a web interface.</p>

        <h1>Building a Simple PaaS with Sidecars</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="platform as a service (PaaS)" id="idm139824748530880"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sidecar patterns" data-secondary="simple PaaS with" id="idm139824740383424"></a>The sidecar pattern can be used for more than adaptation and monitoring.
        It can also be used as a means to implement the complete logic for
        your application in a simplified, modular manner. As an example, imagine
        building a simple platform as a service (PaaS) built around the <code>git</code>
        workflow. Once you deploy this PaaS, simply pushing new code up
        to a Git repository results in that code being deployed to the running
        servers. We’ll see how the sidecar pattern makes building this
        PaaS remarkably straightforward.</p>
        
        <p>As previously stated, in the sidecar pattern there are two containers: the main application container and the sidecar. In our simple PaaS
        application, the main container is a Node.js server that implements
        a web server. The Node.js server is instrumented so that it
        automatically reloads the server when new files are updated. This is
        accomplished with the <a href="https://nodemon.io"><code>nodemon</code> tool</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The sidecar container shares a filesystem with the main application
        container and runs a simple loop that synchronizes the filesystem
        with an existing Git repository:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">#!/bin/bash
        
        while true; do
          git pull
          sleep 10
        done</pre>
        
        <p>Obviously this script could be more complex, pulling from a specific
        branch instead of simply from HEAD. It is left purposefully simple
        to improve the readability of this example.</p>
        
        <p>The Node.js application and Git synchronization sidecar are coscheduled
        and deployed together to implement our simple PaaS (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig-sidecar-paas">Figure&nbsp;2-4</a>).
        Once deployed, every time new code is pushed to a Git repository, the
        code is automatically updated by the sidecar and reloaded by the server.</p>

        can dramatically speed up the building of your application.</p>
        
        <p>However, this modularity and reusability, just like achieving modularity in high-quality software development requires focus and discipline. In particular, you need to focus on developing three areas:</p>

        <p>What do I mean when I say “parameterize”? Consider your container as a function in your program. How many parameters does it have?
        Each parameter represents an input that can customize a generic
        container to a specific situation. Consider, for example, the SSL
        add-on sidecar deployed previously. To be generally useful, it likely
        needs at least two parameters: the first is the name of the
        certificate being used to provide SSL, and the other is the port
        of the “legacy” application server running on localhost. Without
        these parameters, it is hard to imagine this sidecar container being
        usable for a broad array of applications. Similar parameters exist for
        all of the other sidecars described in this chapter.</p>
        
        <p>Now that we know the parameters we  want to expose, how do we actually
        expose them to users, and how do we consume them
        inside the container. There are two ways in which such parameters can
        be passed to your container: through environment variables or the
        command line. Though either is feasible, I have a general preference for
        passing parameters via environment variables. An example of passing
        such parameters to a sidecar container is:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker">docker run -e<code class="o">=</code><code class="nv">PORT</code><code class="o">=</code>&lt;port&gt; -d &lt;image&gt;</pre>
        
        <p>Of course, delivering values into the container is only part of the battle. The other part is actually using these variables inside the container.
        Typically, to do that, a simple shell script is used that loads
        the environment variables supplied with the sidecar container and
        either adjusts the configuration files or parameterizes the underlying
        application.</p>
        
        <p>For example, you might pass in the certificate path and port as
        environment variables:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker">docker run -e<code class="o">=</code><code class="nv">PROXY_PORT</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="m">8080</code> -e<code class="o">=</code><code class="nv">CERTIFICATE_PATH</code><code class="o">=</code>/path/to/cert.crt ...</pre>
        
        <p>In your container, you would use those variables to configure an
        <code>nginx.conf</code> file that points the web server to the correct file and proxy location.</p>

        <h2>Define Each Container’s API</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="APIs" data-secondary="for sidecar containers" id="idm139824739778160"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sidecar patterns" data-secondary="defining container APIs" id="idm139824739777184"></a>Given that you are parameterizing your containers, it is obvious
        that your containers are defining a “function” that is called
        whenever the container is executed. This function is clearly a part
        of the API that is defined by your container, but there are other
        parts to this API as well, including calls that the container will make to other services as well as traditional HTTP or other APIs that the
        container provides.</p>
        
        <p>As you think about defining modular, reusable containers, it is
        important to realize that all aspects of how your container interacts
        with its world are part of the API defined by that reusable container.
        As in the world of microservices, these <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="micro-containers" id="idm139824739775024"></a><em>micro-containers</em> rely on
        APIs to ensure that there is a clean separation between the main
        application container and the sidecar. Additionally the API exists
        to ensure that all consumers of the sidecar will continue to work
        correctly as subsequent versions are released. Likewise,
        having a clean API for a sidecar enables the sidecar developer to
        move more quickly since they have a clear definition (and hopefully
        unit tests) for the services they provide as a part of the sidecar.</p>
        
        <p>To see a concrete example of why this API surface area is important,
        consider the configuration management sidecar we discussed
        earlier. A useful configuration for this sidecar might be <code>UPDATE_FREQUENCY</code>, which indicates how often the configuration should
        be synchronized with the filesystem. It is clear that if, at some
        later time, the name of the parameter is changed to <code>UPDATE_PERIOD</code>, this change would be a violation of the sidecar’s API and clearly
        would break it for some users.</p>
        
        <p>While that example is obvious, even more subtle changes can break
        the sidecar API. Imagine, for example, that <code>UPDATE_FREQUENCY</code>
        originally took a number in seconds. Over time and with feedback from
        users, the sidecar developer determined that specifying seconds for
        large time values (e.g., minutes) was annoying users and
        changed the parameter to accept strings (10 m, 5 s, etc.). Because
        old parameter values (e.g., 10, for
        10 seconds) won’t parse in this new scheme, this is a
        breaking API change. Suppose still that the developer anticipated
        this but made values without units parse to milliseconds where
        they had previously parsed to seconds. Even this change, despite
        not leading to an error, is a breaking API change for the sidecar
        since it will lead to significantly more frequent configuration
        checks and correspondingly more load on the cloud
        configuration server.</p>
        
        <p>I hope this discussion has shown you that for true modularity, you
        need to be very conscious of the API that your sidecar provides,
        and that “breaking” changes to that API may not always be as obvious
        as changing the name of a parameter.</p>

        <h2>Documenting Your Containers</h2>

        make them modular and reuseable. You’ve learned about the importance
        of maintaining a stable API to ensure that you don’t break sidecars for your users. But there’s one final step to building modular,
        reusable containers: ensuring that people can use them in the first
        place.</p>
        
        <p>As with software libraries, the key to building something truly useful
        is explaining how to use it. There is little good in building a
        flexible, reliable modular container if no one can figure out how to
        use it. Sadly, there are few formal tools available for documenting container images, but there are some best practices you can use to accomplish this.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Dockerfile" id="idm139824739663808"></a>For every container image, the most obvious place to look for
        documentation is the <code>Dockerfile</code> from which the container was built.
        There are some parts of the <code>Dockerfile</code> that already document how
        the container works. One example of this is the <code>EXPOSE</code> directive,
        which indicates the ports that the image listens on. Even though <code>EXPOSE</code>
        is not necessary, it is a good practice to include it in your
        <code>Dockerfile</code> and also to add a comment that explains what exactly is
        listening on that port. For example:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker">...
        
        <code class="c"># Main web server runs on port 8080</code>
        <code class="k">EXPOSE</code><code class="s"> 8080</code>
        ...</pre>
        
        <p>Additionally, if you use environment variables to parameterize your
        container, you can use the <code>ENV</code> directive to set default values for
        those parameters as well as document their usage:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker">...
        
        <code class="c"># The PROXY_PORT parameter indicates the port on localhost to redirect</code>
        <code class="c"># traffic to.</code>
        <code class="k">ENV</code><code class="s"> PROXY_PORT 8000</code>
        ...</pre>
        
        <p>Finally, you should always use the <code>LABEL</code> directive to add metadata
        for your image; for example, the maintainer’s email address,
        web page, and version of the image:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="docker">...
        
        LABEL <code class="s2">"org.label-schema.vendor"</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="s2">"name@company.com"</code>
        LABEL <code class="s2">"org.label.url"</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="s2">"http://images.company.com/my-cool-image"</code>
        LABEL <code class="s2">"org.label-schema.version"</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="s2">"1.0.3"</code>
        ...</pre>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Label Schema project" id="idm139824739719280"></a>The names for these labels are drawn from the schema established by
        the <a href="http://label-schema.org/rc1">Label Schema project</a>. The project is
        working to establish a shared set of well-known labels. By using
        a common taxonomy of image labels, multiple different tools can
        rely on the same meta information in order to visualize, monitor, and
        correctly use an application. By adopting shared terms, you can
        use the set of tools developed in the community without modifying
        your image. Of course, you can also add whatever additional labels make
        sense in the context of your image.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch03-asciidoc3" id="idm139824739717456"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch03-asciidoc2" id="idm139824739716816"></a></p>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        
        <p>Over the course of this chapter, we’ve introduced the sidecar pattern
        for combining containers on a single machine.
        In the sidecar pattern, a sidecar container augments and extends
        an application container to add functionality. Sidecars can be used to
        update existing legacy applications when changing the application
        is too costly. Likewise, they can be used to create modular utility containers that standardize implementations of common
        functionality. These utility containers can be reused in a large
        number of applications, increasing consistency and reducing the cost
        of developing each application.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch03-asciidoc1" id="idm139824739701088"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch03-asciidoc0" id="idm139824739700384"></a> Subsequent chapters introduce other
        single-node patterns that demonstrate other uses for modular,
        reusable containers.</p>
