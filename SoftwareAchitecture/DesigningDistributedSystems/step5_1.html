These groups are tightly coupled, symbiotic systems. They depend on local, shared resources like disk, network interface, or inter-process communications. Such collections of containers are important patterns, but they are also building blocks for larger systems. Reliability, scalability, and separation of concerns dictate that real-world systems are built out of many different components, spread across multiple machines. In contrast to single-node patterns, the multi-node distributed patterns are more loosely coupled. While the patterns dictate patterns of communication between the components, this communication is based on network calls. Furthermore,
        many calls are issued in parallel, and systems coordinate via loose synchronization rather than tight constraints.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to Microservices</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="basics" id="ix_ch06-asciidoc2"></a>Recently, the term <em>microservices</em> has become a buzzword for describing multi-node distributed software architectures. Microservices describe a system built out of many different components running in different processes and communicating over defined APIs. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monolithic systems, microservices vs." id="idm139824738814080"></a>Microservices stand in contrast to <em>monolithic</em> systems, which tend to place all of the functionality for a service within a single, tightly coordinated application. These two different architectural approaches are shown
        in Figures <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#fig-monolithic-single-container">II-1</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#fig-microservice-architecture-separate-microservice">II-2</a>.</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="advantages of" id="idm139824738736544"></a>There are numerous benefits to the microservices approach, most of them are centered around reliability and agility. Microservices break down an application into small pieces, each focused on providing a single service. This reduced scope enables each service to be built and maintained by a single “two pizza” team. Reduced team size also reduces
        the overhead associated with keeping a team focused and moving in one direction.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="APIs" data-secondary="for microservices" id="idm139824738734848"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="decoupling of microservices" id="idm139824738733872"></a>Additionally, the introduction of formal APIs in between different
        microservices decouples the teams from one another and provides a reliable contract between the different services. This formal contract
        reduces the need for tight synchronization among the teams
        because the team providing the API understands the surface area that it needs to keep stable, and the team consuming the API can rely on a stable service without worrying about its details. This decoupling enables teams to independently manage their code and release schedules, which in turn improves each team’s ability to iterate and improve their code.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="scaling" data-secondary="microservice decoupling and" id="idm139824738732208"></a>Finally, the decoupling of microservices enables better scaling. Because each component has been broken out into its own service, it can be scaled independently. It is rare for each service within a larger application to grow at the same rate, or have the same way of scaling. Some systems are stateless and can simply scale horizontally, whereas other
        systems maintain state and require sharding or other approaches to scale. By separating each service out, each service can use the approach
        to scaling that suits it best. This is not possible when all services
        are part of a single monolith.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="debugging, microservices-based systems and" id="idm139824738730224"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="microservices" data-secondary="disadvantages of" id="idm139824738729488"></a>But of course there are downsides to the microservices approach to system
        design as well. The two foremost disadvantages are that because the system has become more loosely coupled, debugging the system when failures occur
        is significantly more difficult. You can no longer simply load a single
        application into a debugger and determine what went wrong. Any errors are the byproducts of a large number of systems often running on different machines. This environment is quite challenging to reproduce in a debugger. As a corollary, microservices-based systems are also difficult to design and architect. A microservices-based system uses multiple methods of communicating between services; different patterns (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, message-passing, etc.); and multiple different patterns of coordination and control among the services.</p>
        
        <p>These challenges are the motivation for distributed patterns. If a microservices architecture is made up of well-known patterns, then it is easier to design because many of the design practices are specified by the patterns. Additionally, patterns make the systems easier to debug because they enable developers to apply lessons learned across a number of different systems that use the same patterns.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch06-asciidoc2" id="idm139824738726752"></a></p>
        
        <p>With that in mind, this section introduces a number of multi-node patterns for building distributed systems. These patterns are not mutually exclusive. Any real-world system will be built from a collection of these patterns working together to produce a single higher-level application.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch06-asciidoc1" id="idm139824738725360"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch06-asciidoc0" id="idm139824738724656"></a></p>
