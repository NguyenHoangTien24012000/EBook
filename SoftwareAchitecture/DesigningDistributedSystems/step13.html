        <h1><span class="label">Chapter 13. </span>Conclusion: A New Beginning?</h1>
        
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed systems (generally)" data-secondary="future of" id="idm139824735628976"></a>Every company, regardless of its origins, is becoming a digital company.
        This transformation requires the delivery of APIs and services to be consumed
        by mobile applications, devices in the internet of things (IoT), or even
        autonomous vehicles and systems. The increasing criticality of these systems
        means that it is necessary for these online systems to be built for
        redundancy, fault tolerance, and high availability. At the same time, the
        requirements of business necessitate rapid agility to develop and roll
        out new software, iterate on existing applications, or experiment with new
        user interfaces and APIs. The confluence of these requirements has led to
        an order of magnitude increase in the number of distributed systems that
        need to be built.</p>
        
        <p>The task of building these systems is still far too difficult. The overall
        cost of developing, updating, and maintaining such a system is far too high.
        Likewise, the set of people with the capabilities and skills to build such
        applications is far too small to address the growing need.</p>
        
        <p>Historically, when these situations presented themselves in software
        development and technology, new abstraction layers and patterns of
        software development emerged to make building software faster, easier,
        and more reliable. This first occurred with the development of the first
        compilers and programming languages. Later, the development of object-oriented
        programming languages and managed code occurred. Likewise, at each of these moments,
        these technical developments crystallized the distillation of the knowledge
        and practices of experts into a series of algorithms and patterns that
        could be applied by a much wider group of practitioners. Technological
        advancement combined with the establishment of patterns democratized the
        process of developing software and expanded the set of developers who
        could build applications on the new platform. This in turn led to the
        development of more applications and application diversity, which
        in turn expanded the market for these developer’s skills.</p>
        
        <p>Again, we find ourselves at a moment of technological transformation. The
        need for distributed systems far exceeds our ability to deliver them.
        Fortunately, the development of technology has produced another set of
        tools to further expand the pool of developers capable of building
        these distributed systems. The recent development of containers and
        container orchestration has brought tools that enable rapid, easier
        development of distributed systems. With luck, these tools, when
        combined with the patterns and practices described in this book, can
        enhance and improve the distributed systems built by current
        developers, and more importantly develop a whole new expanded group
        of developers capable of building these systems.</p>
        
        <p>Patterns like sidecars, ambassadors, sharded services, FaaS,
        work queues, and more can form the foundation on which modern distributed
        systems are built. Distributed system developers should no longer be building
        their systems from scratch as individuals but rather collaborating together
        on reusable, shared implementations of canonical patterns that form
        the basis of all of the systems we collectively deploy. This will enable
        us to meet the demands of today’s reliable, scalable APIs and services and
        empower a new set of applications and services for the future.</p>
