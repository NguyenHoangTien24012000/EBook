        <p>At this point, nearly every developer is a developer or consumer
        (or both) of distributed systems. Even relatively simple mobile
        applications are backed with cloud APIs so that their data can be
        present on whatever device the customer happens to be using.
        Whether you are new to developing distributed systems or an expert
        with scars on your hands to prove it, the patterns and
        components described in this book can transform your development
        of distributed systems from art to science. Reusable
        components and patterns for distributed systems will enable you to focus
        on the core details of your application. This book will help any
        developer become better, faster, and more efficient at building
        distributed systems.</p>

        <h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>
        
        <p>Throughout my career as a developer of a variety of software systems from web search to the cloud, I have built a large
        number of scalable, reliable distributed systems. Each of these systems
        was, by and large, built from scratch. In general, this is true of all
        distributed applications. Despite having many of the same concepts
        and even at times nearly identical logic, the ability to apply patterns
        or reuse components is often very, very challenging. This forced
        me to waste time reimplementing systems, and each system ended up less
        polished than it might have otherwise been.</p>
        
        <p>The recent introduction of containers and container orchestrators fundamentally changed the landscape of
        distributed system development. Suddenly we have an object and interface
        for expressing core distributed system patterns and building reusable
        containerized components. I wrote this book to bring together all of
        the practitioners of distributed systems, giving us a shared language
        and common standard library so that we can all build better systems more quickly.</p>

        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="The World of Distributed Systems Today"><div class="sect1" id="idm139824744775600">
        <h1>The World of Distributed Systems Today</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed systems (generally)" data-secondary="current state of" id="idm139824744702160"></a>Once upon a time, people wrote programs that ran on one machine and
        were also accessed from that machine. The world has changed. Now, nearly
        every application is a <em>distributed system</em> running on
        multiple machines and accessed by multiple users from all over the
        world. Despite their prevalence, the design and
        development of these systems is often a black art practiced by a
        select group of wizards. But as with everything in technology, the
        world of distributed systems is advancing, regularizing, and abstracting.
        In this book I capture a collection of repeatable, generic patterns
        that can make the development of reliable distributed systems more
        approachable and efficient. The adoption of patterns
        and reusable components frees developers from reimplementing the same
        systems over and over again. This time is then freed to focus on
        building the core application itself.</p>

        <h1>Navigating This Book</h1>
        
        <p>This book is organized into a 4 parts as follows:</p>
        <dl>

        <dd>
        <p>Introduces distributed systems and explains why patterns and
        reusable components can make such a difference in the rapid development
        of reliable distributed systems.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part01.html#part01">Part&nbsp;I, <em>Single-Node Patterns</em></a></dt>

        occur on individual nodes within a distributed system. It covers the
        side-car, adapter, and ambassador single-node patterns.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part02.html#part02">Part&nbsp;II, <em>Serving Patterns</em></a></dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch08.html#functions_id">8</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.html#master_election_id">9</a> cover multi-node distributed patterns for long-running serving systems like web applications. Patterns for replicating, scaling, and master election are discussed.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part03.html#part03">Part&nbsp;III, <em>Batch Computational Patterns</em></a></dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch10.html#work_queues_id">10</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch12.html#coordinated_processing_id">12</a> cover distributed system patterns for
        large-scale batch data processing covering work queues, event-based
        processing, and coordinated workflows.</p>
        </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>If you are an experienced distributed systems engineer, you can likely
        skip the first couple of chapters, though you may want to skim them
        to understand how we expect these patterns to be applied and why we
        think the general notion of distributed system patterns is so important.</p>
        
        <p>Everyone will likely find utility in the single-node patterns as they
        are the most generic and most reusable patterns in the book.</p>
        
        <p>Depending on your goals and the systems you are interested in developing,
        you can choose to focus on either large-scale big data patterns, or
        patterns for long-running servers (or both). The two parts
        are largely independent from each other and can be read in any order.</p>
        
        <p>Likewise, if you have extensive distributed system experience, you may
        find that some of the early patterns chapters (e.g., <a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#part02">Part&nbsp;II</a> on
        naming, discovery, and load balancing) are redundant with what you
        already know, so feel free to skim through to gain the high-level insights—but don’t forget to look at all of the pretty pictures!</p>
