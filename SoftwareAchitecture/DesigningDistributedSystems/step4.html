        extend and augment existing application containers. We also saw
        how ambassadors can alter and broker how an application container
        communicates with the external world. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="adapter patterns" data-secondary="about" id="idm139824738920576"></a>This chapter describes the final
        single-node pattern: the <em>adapter</em> pattern. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="adapter containers" id="idm139824738919120"></a>In the adapter pattern,
        the <em>adapter container</em> is used to modify the interface of the <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="application containers" data-secondary="adapter container and" id="idm139824738917872"></a><em>application container</em> so that it conforms to some predefined interface that is
        expected of all applications. For example, an adapter might ensure that
        an application implements a consistent monitoring interface. Or it
        might ensure that log files are always written to <code>stdout</code> or any
        number of other conventions.</p>
        
        <p>Real-world application development is a heterogeneous, hybrid exercise.
        Some parts of your application might be written from scratch by your team,
        some supplied by vendors, and some might consist entirely of off-the-shelf
        open source or proprietary software that you consume as precompiled
        binary. The net effect of this heterogeneity is that any real-world
        application you deploy will have been written in a variety of languages,
        with a variety of conventions for logging, monitoring, and other common
        services.</p>
        
        <p>Yet, to effectively monitor and operate your application, you need
        common interfaces. When each application provides metrics using a different format and interface, it is very difficult to
        collect all of those metrics in a single place for visualization and
        alerting. This is where the adapter pattern is relevant. Like other
        single-node patterns, the adapter pattern is made up of modular containers. Different application containers can present many different
        monitoring interfaces while the adapter container adapts this heterogeneity to present a consistent interface. This enables you to
        deploy a single tool that expects this single interface. <a data-type="xref" href="#fig-generic-adapter-pattern">Figure&nbsp;4-1</a> illustrates this general pattern.</p>

        the adapter pattern.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Monitoring"><div class="sect1" id="idm139824738910608">
        <h1>Monitoring</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="adapter patterns" data-secondary="for monitoring" id="ix_ch05-asciidoc2"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monitoring" data-secondary="adapter patterns for" id="ix_ch05-asciidoc3"></a>When monitoring your software, you want a single solution
        that can automatically discover and monitor any application that is
        deployed into your environment. To make this feasible, every application
        has to implement the same monitoring interface. There are numerous
        examples of standardized monitoring interfaces, such as <code>syslog</code>,
        event tracing on Windows (etw), JMX for Java applications, and many,
        many other protocols and interfaces. However, each of these is unique
        in both protocol for communication as well as the style of communication
        (push versus pull).</p>
        
        <p>Sadly, applications in your distributed system
        are likely to span the gamut from code that you have written yourself
        to off-the-shelf open source components. As a result, you will find
        yourself with a wide range of different monitoring interfaces that
        you need to integrate into a single well-understood system.</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, most monitoring solutions understand that they need to
        be widely applicable, and thus they have implemented a variety of
        plugins that can adapt one monitoring format to a common interface.
        Given this set of tools, how can we deploy and manage our applications
        in an agile and stable manner? Fortunately, the adapter pattern
        can provide us with the answers. Applying the adapter pattern to
        monitoring, we see that the application container is simply the
        application that we want to monitor. The adapter container contains
        the tools for transforming the monitoring interface exposed by the
        application container into the interface expected by the general-purpose monitoring system.</p>
        
        <p>Decoupling the system in this fashion
        makes for a more comprehensible, maintainable system. Rolling out
        new versions of the application doesnâ€™t require a rollout of the
        monitoring adapter. Additionally, the monitoring container can be
        reused with multiple different application containers. The monitoring
        container may even have been supplied by the monitoring system
        maintainers independent of the application developers. Finally, deploying
        the monitoring adapter as a separate container ensures that each
        container gets its own dedicated resources in terms of both CPU and
        memory. This ensures that a misbehaving monitoring adapter cannot
        cause problems with a user-facing service.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Hands On: Using Prometheus for Monitoring"><div class="sect2" id="idm139824738902496">
        <h2>Hands On: Using Prometheus for Monitoring</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monitoring" data-secondary="with Prometheus" id="idm139824738901088"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Prometheus" id="idm139824738900112"></a>As an example, consider monitoring your containers via the <a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus open source project</a>. Prometheus is a
        monitoring aggregator, which collects metrics and aggregates them
        into a single time-series database. On top of this database, Prometheus
        provides visualization and query language for introspecting the
        collected metrics. To collect metrics from a variety of different
        systems, Prometheus expects every container to expose a specific
        <code>metrics</code> API. This enables Prometheus to monitor a wide variety of
        different programs through a single interface.</p>
        
        <p>However, many popular programs, such as the Redis key-value store,
        do not export metrics in a format that is compatible with Prometheus.
        <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Redis" data-secondary="and adapter pattern" id="idm139824738897200"></a>Consequently, the adapter pattern is quite useful for taking an
        existing service like Redis and adapting it to the Prometheus metrics-collection interface.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="pod definition for Redis server" id="idm139824738895664"></a>Consider a simple Kubernetes pod definition for a Redis server:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: adapter-example
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: redis
            name: redis</pre>
        
        <p>At this point, this container is not capable of being monitored by
        Prometheus because it does not export the right interface. However,
        if we simply add an adapter container (in this case, an open source
        Prometheus exporter), we can modify this pod to export the correct
        interface and thus adapt it to fit Prometheusâ€™s expectations:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: adapter-example
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: redis
            name: redis
         # Provide an adapter that implements the Prometheus interface
          - image: oliver006/redis_exporter
            name: adapter</pre>
        
        <p>This example illustrates not only the value of the adapter pattern for
        ensuring a consistent interface, but also the value of container
        patterns in general for modular container reuse. In this case, the
        example shown combines an existing Redis container with an existing
        Prometheus adapter. The net effect is a monitorable Redis server, with
        little work on our part to deploy it. In the absence of the adapter
        pattern, the same deployment would have required significantly more
        custom work and would have resulted in a much less operable solution,
        since any updates to either Redis or the adapter would have required
        work to apply the update.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc3" id="idm139824738890992"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc2" id="idm139824738890288"></a></p>

        <h1>Logging</h1>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="adapter patterns" data-secondary="for logging" id="ix_ch05-asciidoc4"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logging" data-secondary="adapter patterns for" id="ix_ch05-asciidoc5"></a>Much like monitoring, there is a wide variety of heterogeneity in how
        systems log data to an output stream. Systems might divide their logs
        into different levels (such as debug, info, warning, and error)
        with each level going into a different file. Some might simply log to
        <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>. This is especially problematic in the world of
        containerized applications where there is a general expectation
        that your containers will log to <code>stdout</code>, because that is what is
        available via commands like <code>docker logs</code> or <code>kubectl logs</code>.</p>
        
        <p>Adding further complexity, the information logged generally has
        structured information (e.g., the date/time of the log), but
        this information varies widely between different logging libraries (e.g., Javaâ€™s built-in logging versus the <code>glog</code> package for Go).</p>
        
        <p>Of course, when you are storing and querying the logs for your
        distributed system, you donâ€™t really care about these differences in
        logging format. You want to ensure that despite different structures
        for the data, every log ends up with the appropriate timestamp.</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, as with monitoring, the adapter pattern can help provide
        a modular, re-usable design for both of these situations. While the
        application container may log to a file, the adapter container can
        redirect that file to <code>stdout</code>.  Different application containers can
        log information in different formats, but the adapter container can
        transform that data into a single structured representation that
        can be consumed by your log aggregator. Again, the adapter is taking
        a heterogeneous world of applications and creating a homogenous world
        of common interfaces.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p>One question that often comes up when considering adapter patterns is:
        Why not simply modify the application container
        itself? If you are the developer responsible for the application
        container, then this might actually be a good solution. Adapting
        your code or your container to implement a consistent interface can work well. However, in many cases we are reusing a container
        produced by another party. In such cases, deriving a slightly modified
        image that we have to maintain (patch, rebase, etc.) is significantly
        more expensive than developing an adapter container that can run
        alongside the other partyâ€™s image. Additionally, decoupling the
        adapter into its own container allows for the possibility of sharing
        and reuse, which isnâ€™t possible when you modify the application
        container.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Hands On: Normalizing Different Logging Formats with Fluentd"><div class="sect2" id="idm139824738877712">
        <h2>Hands On: Normalizing Different Logging Formats with Fluentd</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fluentd" id="idm139824738876304"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="logging" data-secondary="normalizing different formats with fluentd" id="idm139824738875600"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Redis" data-secondary="and adapter pattern" id="idm139824738874624"></a>One common task for an adapter is to normalize log metrics into
        a standard set of events. Many different applications have different
        output formats, but you can use a standard logging tool deployed as
        an adapter to normalize them all to a consistent format. In this
        example, we will use the fluentd monitoring agent as well as some
        community-supported plugins to obtain logs from a variety of different
        sources.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://fluentd.org"><code>fluentd</code></a> is one of the more popular open source logging agents available. One of its major features is a rich set of community-supported plugins that enable a great deal of flexibility in monitoring a variety of applications.</p>
        
        <p>The first application that we will monitor is Redis. Redis is a popular
        key-value store; one of the commands it offers is the <code>SLOWLOG</code>
        command. This command lists recent queries that exceeded a particular
        time interval. Such information is quite useful in debugging your
        applicationâ€™s performance. Unfortunately, <code>SLOWLOG</code> is only available
        as a command on the Redis server, which means that it is difficult to
        use retrospectively if a problem happens when someone isnâ€™t available
        to debug the server. To fix this limitation, we can use <code>fluentd</code> and
        the adapter pattern to add slow-query logging to Redis.</p>
        
        <p>To do this, we use the adapter pattern with a <code>redis</code> container as the
        main application container, and the <code>fluentd</code> container as our adapter
        container. In this case, we will also use the <a href="https://github.com/mominosin/fluent-plugin-redis-slowlog"><code>fluent-plugin-redis-slowlog</code></a> <code>fluentd</code> plugin to listen to the slow queries. We can configure this plugin using the following snippet:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">&lt;source&gt;
          type redis_slowlog
          host localhost
          port 6379
          tag redis.slowlog
        &lt;/source&gt;</pre>
        
        <p>Because we are using an adapter and the containers both share a
        network namespace, configuring the logging simply uses <code>localhost</code>
        and the default Redis port (6379). Given this application of the
        adapter pattern, logging will always be available whenever we want
        to debug slow Redis queries.</p>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Apache Storm" id="idm139824738864720"></a>A similar exercise can be done to monitor logs from the <a href="https://storm.apache.org">Apache Storm</a> system. Again, Storm provides data via a RESTful API, which is useful but has limitations if we are not currently
        monitoring the system when a problem occurs. Like Redis, we can use
        a <code>fluentd</code> adapter to transfor the Storm process into a time series
        of queryable logs. To do this, we deploy a <code>fluentd</code> adapter with the <code>fluent-plugin-storm</code> plugin enabled. We can configure this plugin with
        a <code>fluentd</code> config pointed at localhost (because again, we are running as
        a container group with a shared localhost); the config for the plugin
        looks like:<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc5" id="idm139824738860800"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc4" id="idm139824738860096"></a></p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">&lt;source&gt;
          type storm
          tag storm
          url http://localhost:8080

        monitoring the health of an application container. Consider the
        task of monitoring the health of an off-the-shelf database container.
        In this case, the container for the database is supplied by the
        database project, and we would rather not modify that container
        simply to add health checks. Of course, a container orchestrator
        will allow us to add simple health checks to ensure that the process
        is running and that it is listening on a particular port, but what
        if we want to add richer health checks that actually run queries
        against the database?</p>
        
        <p>Container orchestration systems like Kubernetes enable us to use
        shell scripts as health checks as well. Given this capability, we
        can write a rich shell script that runs a number of different
        diagnostic queries against the database to determine its health.
        But where can we store such a script and how can we version it?</p>
        
        <p>The answer to these problems should be easy to guess by now: <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="adapter containers" id="idm139824738847088"></a>we can
        use an adapter container. The database runs in the application container and shares a network interface with the adapter container.
        The adapter container is a simple container that only contains the
        shell script for determining the health of the database. This script
        can then be set up as the health check for the database container and
        can perform whatever rich health checks our application requires.
        If these checks ever fail, the database will be automatically restarted.</p>

        <h2>Hands On: Adding Rich Health Monitoring for MySQL</h2>
        
        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="health monitoring" data-secondary="for MySQL" id="ix_ch05-asciidoc13"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="MySQL database" data-secondary="rich health monitoring for" id="ix_ch05-asciidoc14"></a>Suppose then that you want to add deep monitoring on a MySQL database
        where you actually run a query that was representative of your workload. In this case, one option would be to update the MySQL container to
        contain a health check that is specific to your application.
        However, this is generally an unattractive idea because it requires that
        you both modify some existing MySQL base image as well as update
        that image as new MySQL images are released.</p>
        
        <p>Using the adapter pattern is a much more attractive approach to
        adding health checks to your database container. Instead of modifying
        the existing MySQL container, you can add an additional adapter
        container to the pre-existing MySQL container, which runs the
        appropriate query to test the database health. Given that this
        adapter container implements the expected HTTP health check, it is simply a case of defining the MySQL database processâ€™s
        health check in terms of the interface exposed by this database
        adapter.</p>
        
        <p>The source code for this adapter is relatively straightforward and
        looks like this in Go (though clearly other language implementations are possible as well):</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">package main
        
        import (
            "database/sql"
            "flag"
            "fmt"
            "net/http"
        
            _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
        )
        
        var (
            user   = flag.String("user", "", "The database user name")
            passwd = flag.String("password", "", "The database password")
            db     = flag.String("database", "", "The database to connect to")
            query  = flag.String("query", "", "The test query")
            addr   = flag.String("address", "localhost:8080",
                                "The address to listen on")
        )
        
        // Basic usage:
        //   db-check --query="SELECT * from my-cool-table" \
        //            --user=bdburns \
        //            --passwd="you wish"
        //
        func main() {
            flag.Parse()
            db, err := sql.Open("localhost",
                                fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s@/%s", *user, *passwd, *db))
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("Error opening database: %v", err)
            }
        
         // Simple web handler that runs the query
            http.HandleFunc("", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
                _, err := db.Exec(*query)
                if err != nil {
                    res.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
                    res.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
                    return
                }
                res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
                res.Write([]byte("OK"))
                return
            })
         // Startup the server
            http.ListenAndServe(*addr, nil)
        }</pre>
        
        <p>We can then build this into a container image and pull it into a pod that looks like:</p>
        
        <pre data-type="programlisting">apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: adapter-example-health
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: mysql
            name: mysql
          - image: brendanburns/mysql-adapter
            name: adapter</pre>
        
        <p>That way, the <code>mysql</code> container is unchanged, but the desired feedback about
        the health of the mysql server can still be obtained from the adapter
        container.</p>
        
        <p>When looking at this application of the adapter pattern, it may seem like
        applying the pattern is superfluous. Clearly we could have built our
        own custom image that knew how to health check the <code>mysql</code> instance
        itself.</p>
        
        <p>While this is true, this method ignores the strong benefits that derive from
        modularity. If every developer implements their own specific
        container with health checking built in, there are no opportunities
        for reuse or sharing.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, if we use patterns like the adapter to develop modular
        solutions comprised of multiple containers, the work is inherently decoupled and more easily shared. An adapter that is developed
        to health check <code>mysql</code> is a module that can be shared and reused
        by a variety of people. Further, people can apply the adapter pattern
        using this shared health-checking container, without having deep knowledge
        of how to health check a <code>mysql</code> database. Thus the modularity and
        adapter pattern serve not to just facilitate sharing, but also to empower people to take advantage of the knowledge of others.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes design patterns arenâ€™t just for the developers who apply them, but lead to the development of communities that can collaborate and share solutions between members of the community as well as the broader developer <a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc14" id="idm139824738830736"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc13" id="idm139824738830032"></a>ecosystem<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc12" id="idm139824738829232"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc11" id="idm139824738828528"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc10" id="idm139824738827856"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc9" id="idm139824738827184"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc8" id="idm139824738826512"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc7" id="idm139824738825840"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc6" id="idm139824738825168"></a>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc1" id="idm139824738824368"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch05-asciidoc0" id="idm139824738823664"></a></p>
