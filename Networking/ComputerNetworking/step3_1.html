        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Security is often placed last in any discussion of network design principles; it is often thought of as an add-on to the main focus of the design process. The modern world, however, is a dangerous place for data, particularly data that can ruin people’s lives <em>permanently</em>.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev1"><a id="page_562"></a>The Scope of the Problem</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Security is a very broad and important topic for network engineers; the following sections will outline why this is so.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev2"><strong>The Biometric Identity Conundrum</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Consider this simple example: many electronic devices have a fingerprint reader that is (often) used in the place of a password. Gaining access to such devices is much simpler than password or pin-driven access; there is no password to remember. It is also (theoretically) more secure. You cannot “steal” someone’s fingerprint.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">Or can you? There are two less than obvious lines of attack. First, you leave your fingerprint everywhere in everyday life. It is on the screen of your cell phone, the doorknob to any building you enter, the door handles on your car (or handlebars on your scooter or bike), and in many other places. People have long been able to lift such prints from a wide array of services. How much of a secret is your fingerprint, really? This same problem applies to any externally visible body characteristic used to identify you: cameras are everywhere, and at least some of them capture just about any part of your body used for identification on a regular basis. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig01">Figure 21-1</a> illustrates this problem.</p>
        <div class="fig-heading">
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780134762814/files/graphics/21fig01.jpg" alt="Image shows a pair of nitrile, finger print examination gloves." width="602" height="366"></div>
        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig01"></a><strong>Figure 21-1</strong> <em>The fingerprint as a password problem</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">The second line of attack is, perhaps, less obvious but maybe more dangerous. No system stores fingerprints as images, per se. Rather, all fingerprint systems store fingerprints as a digitized version of the key characteristics of each fingerprint. <a id="page_563"></a>Certainly such files will be encrypted and protected, and perhaps even just stored locally. Once fingerprint data is taken online, however, all security bets are off. No matter how well protected, data moved across the public Internet has some percentage probability of being stolen at some point. Data breaches are common; for instance, here are a few sample breaches from 2016:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• FACC, a manufacturer of lightweight composites, was the victim of cyber theft worth at least $54.5 million.<sup><a id="ch21fn1"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• The University of Florida, exposing the records of about 63,000 students and staff.<sup><a id="ch21fn2"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• The FBI, exposing the contact information of about 20,000 employees.<sup><a id="ch21fn3"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• The United States Internal Revenue Service, exposing the information of about 220,000 tax payers.<sup><a id="ch21fn4"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-4">4</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• The University of California at Berkley, exposing information of about 80,000 students, faculty, and alumni.<sup><a id="ch21fn5"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-5">5</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• Premier Health Care, exposing information about 200,000 patients.<sup><a id="ch21fn6"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-6">6</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• Verizon Enterprise Services, potentially exposing information about 1.5 million customers.<sup><a id="ch21fn7"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-7">7</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• The City of Salt Lake City, Utah, exposing information about 14,200 people.<sup><a id="ch21fn8"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-8">8</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• Tidewater Community College, exposing information about 3,000 employees.<sup><a id="ch21fn9"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-9">9</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bull">• The voting system of the Philippines, exposing information about 55 million citizens.<sup><a id="ch21fn10"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-10">10</a></sup></p>
        <p class="bullb">• Yahoo, exposing the information of between 500 million and 1 billion users.<sup><a id="ch21fn11"></a><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fn-11">11</a></sup></p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_564"></a>There are hundreds (or thousands) of such breaches each year, many of which escape the notice of the wider public or are not reported at all. Once fingerprints are stored like credit card and other information, it is a matter of time before large caches of fingerprint information are stolen. Of course, not every fingerprint for every person in the world will be stolen in such a breach, but this will be small comfort to those whose fingerprints were stolen.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev3"><strong>Definitions</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">To understand the world of security, it is important to understand some basic terms. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig02">Figure 21-2</a> illustrates the first set of important definitions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fig-heading">
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780134762814/files/graphics/21fig02.jpg" aria-describedby="Al21fig02" alt="Diagrammatic illustration of the Security Definitions." width="713" height="316"><aside class="hidden" id="Al21fig02">
        <p>A human silhouette with a computer is shown at the left of the diagram and is labeled "threat actor or attacker" and the system is labeled "exploits." This system is connected to a network cloud and the connection is labeled "threat or attack." To the right of the network cloud, are three routers B, C, and D, which are connected to the network cloud and to the two servers E and F placed to their right. The routers B, C, and D are collectively labeled "vulnerabilities" and the servers E and F are collectively labeled "assets." The layer with the three routers is labeled "attack surface." To the right of the setup, are icons that represent the resulting risks due to a network breach, such as a microphone and a closed board.</p>
        </aside>
        </div>
        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig02"></a><strong>Figure 21-2</strong> <em>Security definitions</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indentb">In <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig02">Figure 21-2</a>, working from left to right:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• The <strong>threat actor</strong>, or <strong>attacker</strong>, is the individual or organization initiating the attack(s). The identity of the threat actor can help you understand motivations, skill level, and possible plan of attack.</p>
        <p class="bull">• The <strong>exploit</strong> takes advantage of the vulnerability using a process or tool, such as manually entering a specific string, running a script or piece of software, etc.</p>
        <p class="bull">• The <strong>attack</strong> or <strong>threat</strong> is the potential or actual attack performed by the threat actor using the exploit.</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> are potential weak spots in the defense that can be exploited to achieve an objective. For instance, a missing or misconfigured packet filter, someone inside the network with rights to the target system who can be social-engineered to provide access in some way, or a defect in a system’s code allowing a threat actor to attack a system in some way.</p>
        <p class="bull"><a id="page_565"></a>• The <strong>attack surface</strong> is the total set of systems, port numbers, applications, etc., the threat actor has access to in some way.</p>
        <p class="bull">• <strong>Assets</strong> are the network elements and information within the network that the threat actor would either like to access or prevent access to (in the case of a denial of service attack).</p>
        <p class="bullb">• <strong>Risks</strong> are the potential negative results of an attack, such as bad publicity (represented by the microphone), a major business consequence (represented by the breach report), or even a complete failure of the business itself. Risk is often quantified as potential times impact.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev4"><strong>The Problem Space</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The security problem space, from a network perspective, can be divided into three broad areas:</p>
        </div>
        <p class="bullt">• How can users and processes access the data they need to do their jobs?</p>
        <p class="bull">• How can the information carried over the network and stored on devices connected to the network remain confidential?</p>
        <p class="bullb">• How can the network remain accessible? Many attackers would like to disrupt a business or organization by removing the network as a usable resource; this is called a denial of service (DoS) attack.</p>
        <p class="indent">The following section will consider a wide scope of possible solutions to each of these problems. After this, some examples of solutions in the security space will be considered, and then a useful model for considering network security, the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop, will be discussed.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev5">The Solution Space</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Many books, articles, and research papers have been written addressing different elements of security since the first network break-in, which probably happened the day after the first network was operational. The “Further Reading” section will be helpful if you are interested in learning more about security than what is contained in this and later sections in this chapter.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">This section will begin by looking at the concept of defense in depth and then consider three broad security solution spaces: access control, data protection, and service availability assurance.</p>
        <a id="page_566"></a>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev6"><strong>Defense in Depth</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The first, and most important, solution is more conceptual than tool or method oriented. Defense in depth is the concept of having multiple, overlapping layers of defenses interacting in a way that poses multiple challenges to an attacker. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig03">Figure 21-3</a> illustrates one possible set of lines of defense.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fig-heading">
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780134762814/files/graphics/21fig03.jpg" aria-describedby="Al21fig03" alt="Network diagram illustrates the concept of using multiple, overlapping layers for implementing defense in depth." width="713" height="306"><aside class="hidden" id="Al21fig03">
        <p>A cloud representing a network is placed in the middle of the diagram. In the left, a host computer A is connected to a router B through a network cloud, and this router B is connected to a switch C. This switch is connected to the main network placed in the middle. Host A is labeled "outsider threat." The functionalities at router B are listed as access control, route validation and packet filters to the left of the main network. The function at the switch C is stateful packet filters. Another host D, labeled "insider threat" is connected to the main network in the middle. In the right, a switch E is connected to the main network at its left, and to a router F to its right. The router F is connected to a server G. The functions at E is intrusion detection and exfiltration monitoring, which is also done by server G. Server G also does access control. The routers B and F, and the switches C and E together share the function general telemetry.</p>
        </aside>
        </div>
        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig03"></a><strong>Figure 21-3</strong> <em>Defense in depth</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig03">Figure 21-3</a>, there are a number of lines of defense, including</p>
        <p class="bullt">• Packet filters and access controls at the routed edge to the network; these are “basic” controls that just check to see if a user is authorized to access the network in general, block some basic (obvious) packet flows, and even limit the rate at which hosts outside the network can transfer data.</p>
        <p class="bull">• Route validation at the routed edge to the network; this will help prevent access from hijacked address space.</p>
        <p class="bull">• General telemetry throughout the network, which will indicate top talkers, provide information on the most common source/destination pairs, note unusual spikes in utilization, etc.</p>
        <p class="bull">• Stateful packet filters at the middlebox C, which will only allow traffic into the network on some ports if there is an existing connection.</p>
        <p class="bull">• Exfiltration monitoring deployed in several locations; this will raise an alert when specific access patterns occur, such as large amounts of data being transferred toward a destination outside the network from a database containing sensitive user information.</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Access control on individual services and/or servers, such as G, which ensures the user at D is authorized to access individual resources.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_567"></a>Although none of these systems will stop an intruder from breaching your network or data, used together they can provide a fairly effective defense system against many different forms of attack. First, the time a threat actor spends moving through one layer gives the network operator an opportunity to discover and counter the attack with more specific controls. Second, the layering of systems and filters forms a kind of “layer of grids” through which traffic must pass to reach important resources. An attack not blocked by the first grid layer may be blocked by the second, etc.</p>
        <p class="indent">Understanding the in-depth defensive posture of the complete set of systems in a network and using every available resource as a potential defensive system are important skills in the network design space.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev7"><strong>Access Control</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Access control tries to ensure</p>
        </div>
        <p class="bullt">• Users (or processes) are who they claim to be—to verify identity. This is often called authentication.</p>
        <p class="bull">• Users (or processes) are able to access the data they are attempting to access, or rather whether or not they are authorized to use a particular service or access a particular piece of data.</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Information about user actions are recorded so they can be used to trace back to failures and breaches. This is generally called accounting.</p>
        <p class="indent">Access control systems are often called AAA systems, because of the three A’s: authentication, authorization, and accounting. These systems are often specialized applications, interacting with devices through a protocol such as Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) to ensure users are properly logged in and applications have enough information to ensure that only valid and authorized users are accessing information and services.</p>
        <p class="indent">Access control can be implemented in many different places in a system; for instance:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• Before the user connects to the network, or rather before the user can log on to a device that is able to obtain an Internet Protocol (IP) address, connect to an upstream switch, connect to a wireless network, etc.</p>
        <p class="bull">• After the user connects to the network but before the user can access any service.</p>
        <p class="bullb">• After the user connects to the network and before the user accesses each individual service.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_568"></a>These three different options can be combined; for instance, a user may be asked to provide a username and password before connecting to the network, and again before accessing any service on the network, and then again before accessing particular, more highly restricted, systems or information.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev8"><strong>Data Protection</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Consider the protection around a safe holding classified documents. Is it possible the safe might be breached in some way? What if someone calls in a bomb threat to the building where the safe is housed? Will the occupants of the building gather up any necessary equipment and information, including the contents of the safe, and leave the building? Or what if someone who appears to be authorized calls and asks for the data? The safe being breached is similar to an access control failure, and the bomb threat or request for information that drives the data out into the street is similar to a request pulling the information across the network.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">Ultimately, there must be a line of defense to protect data in these sorts of situations; systems and applications will be breached, and data will be requested over the network. Encryption is generally the last line of defense for these situations.</p>
        <div class="sidebar1">
        <p class="title1"><strong>The Man in the Middle and the Control Plane</strong></p>
        <p class="noindent">When data leaves the safe space, many new vulnerabilities come into play. While encryption can help protect data in these situations, it is useful to know what these situations look like, and hence (potentially) what needs to be protected against and what the limits of protection might be. Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks are a common sort of attack in this realm; these attacks are sometimes enabled by an attack on the control plane (an attack on one system that enables an attack on another is called a side attack). <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig04">Figure 21-4</a> is used to illustrate.</p>
        <div class="fig-heading">
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780134762814/files/graphics/21fig04.jpg" aria-describedby="Al21fig04" alt="Network diagram illustrates the concept of man in the middle attack." width="506" height="220"><aside class="hidden" id="Al21fig04">
        <p>Four routers B, C, D, and F are connected to form a ring topology. The router B is connected to a host system A and the router F is connected to a server G. Another system E is shown to be connected to the network path shared by router C and router F. This system E is labeled "attacker."</p>
        </aside>
        </div>
        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig04"></a><strong>Figure 21-4</strong> <em>A man-in-the-middle attack</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig04">Figure 21-4</a>, host A opens a secure session to G. As part of the secure session configuration, A and G must exchange keys and other information to allow an encrypted session to operate. If E, the attacker, can intercept these communications, it can</p>
        <p class="indent">Make A believe it is exchanging information with G, even though it is exchanging information with E</p>
        <p class="indent">Make G believe it is exchanging information with A, even though it is exchanging information with E</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_569"></a>By acting as a man in the middle, E can make A and G believe they are exchanging information securely, when the entire connection is being monitored by E. The problem, for the attacker, is to intercept the traffic between A and G at just the right point in time to allow this kind of attack to work. This may be fairly easy if there is just one path between A and G, but in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig04">Figure 21-4</a> there are two paths. How can the attacker ensure it will see the traffic flowing between A and G? The attacker must exploit some vulnerability in the routing system to ensure traffic between A and G is flowing across the [C,F] link.</p>
        <p class="indent">While not all man-in-the-middle attacks will require compromising the routing system in this way, at least some will; hence the security of the routing system itself can be a security issue, as well. Securing the routing system is very difficult, however. For instance:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• If the destination is only reachable through the public Internet, it is next to impossible to know what the “correct” route is. The Internet is made up of individual networks, each of which has policies intentionally unavailable to other operators.</p>
        <p class="bullb">• If the destination is reachable entirely through an internal network, it would be difficult to detect the [B,C,F] path as an invalid path. Both available paths are “valid” in the sense of being available paths between the source and destination; why one should be considered “more valid” than the other is difficult to discern.</p>
        <p class="indent">These and many other problems plague security in the control plane. While some information can be verified, such as existing connectivity, it is difficult to determine whether or not traffic is following these validated paths. While the network can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks of this kind, some attacks can only be resolved at the protocol and application level.</p>

        <p class="indent"><a id="page_570"></a>Encryption takes a block of information (the plaintext) and encodes it using some form of mathematical operation to obscure the text, resulting in a ciphertext. To recover the original plaintext, the mathematical operations must be reversed. Most encryption is based on the difficulty involved in factoring a large integer composed of two or more prime factors. An integer is calculated based on the key (a prime factor) and some portion of the plaintext, resulting in the ciphertext. To recover the plaintext from the ciphertext, the process is reversed; the key is used to find the factor of the large integers in the ciphertext, ultimately calculating the original plaintext.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are two kinds of widely used encryption: public key and private key. In public key cryptography, more properly called asymmetric cryptography, there are two factors or keys; if the plaintext is encrypted using one of the keys, it can be unencrypted using the second key. This is useful because it allows one of the two keys to be published publicly. In private key cryptography, more properly called symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used to encrypt and unencrypt the plaintext; hence the sender and receiver must share the same key to communicate.</p>
        <p class="indent">Public and private key cryptography are often used together to form a single system. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig05">Figure 21-5</a> is used to illustrate.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="indentb">In <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig05">Figure 21-5</a>:</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">1. Assume A begins the process. A will encrypt a nonce, or rather a large random number, using B’s public key. Because the nonce has been encrypted with B’s public key, in theory only B can unencrypt the nonce, as only B should know B’s private key.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">2. B, on unencrypting the nonce, will now send some new nonce to A. This may include A’s original nonce, or A’s original nonce plus some other information. The point is that A must know, for certain, the original message, including A’s nonce was received by B—and not some other system acting as B. This is ensured by B including some piece of information encrypted using its public key, as B is the only system able to unencrypt it.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_571"></a>3. A and B, using the nonces and other information exchanged to this point, will calculate a private key, which is then used to encrypt/unencrypt information transferred between the two systems.</p>
        <p class="indentt">The steps outlined here are somewhat naive; there are better, more secure, systems, such as the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol; see the “Further Reading” section for resources in this area. Why not just use asymmetric (or public key) cryptography all the time? Because the computational costs of using asymmetric key cryptography are much higher than using symmetric cryptography.</p>
        <p class="indent">A second area to be concerned about in data protection is data exhaust. There are many other terms for this, of course, but the general idea is vulnerabilities in the communication patterns. For instance, assume a bank configures an automated backup for a particular database table; when the balances in the account held in the table change by a particular amount, the backup is kicked off automatically. This might seem like a perfectly reasonable sort of backup job, but it does involve some amount of data exhaust. If a threat actor puts the backup together with the change in account value, he will know specifically what the pattern of account activity is. Enough clues of this sort can be developed into an entire set of attack plans.</p>
        <p class="indent">How can network engineers protect against data exhaust? There are no real good ways to protect against leaking information unintentionally into the public domain through such actions; even in security, the law of leaky abstractions applies. The best you can do is to be aware of such problems, potentially profiling your network the same way an attacker would, and noting any patterns that might be used against your defense system.</p>
        <div class="sidebar1">
        <p class="title1"><strong>Security and Obscurity</strong></p>
        <p class="noindent"><em>No security through obscurity</em>. If you get close enough to a security engineer for long enough, or involved in any sort of debate over proper security, you will likely hear these words somewhere along the way. There is one problem with this phrase, however: it is often used out of context. To understand the real meaning of the phrase, you need to go back in time to the origin of encryption algorithms. In the physical lock world, revealing the plans of a lock will often reveal various passageways to bypassing or defeating the lock. This habit was carried over to early software security vendors; if an attacker knows how the encryption algorithm works, she will be able to find ways to defeat the encryption algorithm.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_572"></a>But encryption algorithms are not door locks; what is an important safeguard in one realm can be a dangerous crutch in another. Hiding code developed to encrypt plaintext does not make the code more secure; in fact, just the opposite happens. Instead of improving security, obscuring encryption code and processes just prevents experts in the field from finding flaws and possible ways to defeat the code before these are exposed in real deployments. Ultimately, security by obscurity is dangerous in this particular context.</p>
        <p class="indent">So this is a good principle, but it can be misapplied. For instance, if a network operator attempts to hide the internal network architecture or addressing, or even block external hosts from reaching internal ones, at least some security experts will counter with “That is security by obscurity; you should not do this.” Taken in this sense, however, <em>encrypting data is also security by obscurity</em>. Hiding information and hiding information about your infrastructure are both essentially hiding information, and hiding information is essentially a form of obscurity.</p>
        <p class="indent">How can you tell when you should apply “no security by obscurity” and when you should not? Perhaps the best rule of thumb is this: hiding processes, algorithms, and implementations is not a useful addition to security in the cyberworld. Hiding information, however, often is. It can be hard to apply this rule of thumb in many situations, but it should be a good start in thinking through the issues and making the right decision in each particular case.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="indent">The process in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig06">Figure 21-6</a> begins before the attack, with the creation of a botnet to use as a platform. Building botnets is mostly a matter of getting as many devices as possible infected with a virus, allowing a controller to instruct the device to send a stream of packets to some IP address on demand. Viruses are designed to infect a wide range of devices, including IoT devices (like light bulbs, refrigerators, video cameras, television sets, etc.), personal computers, cell phones, and web servers (which normally run inside a virtual machine), ultimately allowing them to be controlled in some limited sense by the botnet controller. Such botnets can be rented by the hour fairly easily.</p>
        <p class="indentb"><a id="page_573"></a>Once the botnet is built:</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">1. The botnet controller sends a command for each of the devices, potentially hundreds of thousands of them, to send a series of packets to a set of well-known servers. Any sort of server hosting a widely used public service with a lot of bandwidth and processing power will do; favorites are Domain Name System (DNS) and Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">2. The botnet devices send requests for some piece of information to each server being used as a reflector in the attack. Typically, this is a request for a DNS resolution, or a large text record stored in the DNS table, or something similar. The source of the request is forged or set to the target’s IP address.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">3. The servers respond to the request with large amounts of data, which is then sent to the target device. Some resource, such as available bandwidth, available Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection buffers, or something else with a limited scale, is consumed, preventing the server from operating properly (such as preventing a web server from serving web pages to visitors).</p>
        <p class="indentt">Why do threat actors build and launch these kinds of attacks? There are a number of reasons, including</p>
        <p class="bullt">• To extort money from businesses. A large-scale attack against a well-known target is particularly effective for extortion; a threat actor can send an email to hundreds of companies saying something like: “Did you see the news about <a id="page_574"></a>the big DDoS attack? That was me. If you do not pay me (some large amount of money), you will be next.” If the targeted company perceives it has fewer resources and skills than the well-known target, it may pay rather than trying to defend itself against such a large attack.</p>
        <p class="bull">• To make a political point. Some attacks are targeted at organizations that the threat actor disagrees with politically, such as a company failing to support a specific cause, a rival political party, etc.</p>
        <p class="bull">• To bring down a competitor. Some threat actors sell the service of taking down a rival’s website for some period of time, in order to embarrass the company or drive users to a competitor.</p>
        <p class="bull">• To distract the security team at a company while some other attack is occurring. DDoS attacks are often a useful feint to distract the corporate security team while some form of back door or other vulnerability is created in the victim’s network.</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Because they can. Some people just seem to enjoy wreaking havoc, or they believe it is the only way they will ever become famous.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are a number of ways to defend systems against DDoS attacks, many of which can (and should) be used in parallel.</p>
        <div class="sidebar1">
        <p class="title1"><strong>Reflection, Amplification, and Burner Attacks</strong></p>
        <p class="indent">Why is the indirection off a public server used, rather than using the botnet to attack targets directly? There are generally three reasons. First, servers designed to support large-scale public services, like DNS and NTP, are generally well-connected, high-powered systems. In fact, these are often multiple systems operating behind a single anycast address; such servers will be able to generate a lot more traffic than a collection of hosts connected at the edge of the Internet, and often represent services able to amplify the attack. In an amplification attack, the attacker sends a small request that will result in a large response, directing the response to the victim. Second, these services are not often blocked; since they are large, publicly known services, and normally crucial to the proper operation of the Internet as a whole, they are normally given a “special pass” when it comes to any sort of packet filter. Third, if the actual botnet devices are used, their use reveals their locations to the device and/or network being attacked, as well as the upstream provider to which the systems within the botnet are connected. Once their locations have been revealed, they are often blocked, or some form of mitigation takes place, making the devices used in a direct attack much less useful in future attacks. Direct attacks are sometimes called burner attacks because of how they reveal the botnet itself; the resources have been outed and hence burned.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch21level1"><a id="page_575"></a><em><strong>Modifications to Host Operating Systems</strong></em></h5>
        <p class="noindent">Some modifications can be made to host operating systems that will allow the server to withstand the traffic of a DDoS attack while continuing to provide service (though perhaps more slowly). These modifications primarily relate to making more resources available, closing incomplete connection requests more quickly, more quickly aging out cached information that is not currently being used, and other measures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch21level2"><em><strong>Blocking Half-Open and Malformed Sessions</strong></em></h5>
        <p class="noindent">Server protocol implementations, and even (to some degree) on-edge routers, can block half-open and malformed sessions. A normal Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session setup has multiple steps:</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indenthangingN">1. The client requests a connection by sending a synchronize (SYN) packet to the server.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">2. The server replies with an acknowledgment of the connection request (SYN-ACK).</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">3. The client acknowledges receipt of the SYN-ACK with an ACK; the three-way handshake is complete, and data can be transmitted over the session.</p>
        <p class="indentt">In some TCP DDoS attacks, the client will send the SYN but never acknowledge the SYN-ACK. This is called a half-open session. Open ports represent consumed resources on the server while costing the attacker very little. Many routers and stateful packet inspection devices can drop half-open TCP sessions.</p>
        <p class="indent">Another option in the case of TCP-based DDoS attacks is for the server to push processing work back onto the systems used in the attack. One way to do this is to allow the server to respond to TCP SYN messages with a malformed SYN-ACK. If the client is running a well-designed, unmodified TCP implementation, this will cause the system used in the attack to spend processing and memory resources reporting the error back to the server. This additional load will reduce the amount of bandwidth and processing power the botnet has available to pursue the attack.</p>
        <p class="indent">Very few of these responses will work as responses to attacks based on sessionless transport protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch21level3"><em><strong>Rate Limiting</strong></em></h5>
        <p class="noindent">Many operating systems offer the ability to limit the number of incoming connection requests over a specific time scale (usually something like <em>x hundred/thousand connection requests per second</em>). Some network devices extend this concept to control plane protection, which limits the rate at which information is transmitted from <a id="page_576"></a>the data plane into the control plane for processing. These schemes do save resources but often at a cost: both good and bad traffic are dropped. Schemes may be applied to drop just bad traffic, but defining bad traffic is difficult. <em>There is no evil bit in the IP packet</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">
        <h5 class="h5" id="ch21level4"><em><strong>Spreading Traffic across Multiple Servers</strong></em></h5>
        <p class="noindent">For operators with a very large (or dispersed) edge, it is possible to use routing controls to spread the DDoS traffic among as many entry points into the network as possible. For instance, a 1T attack, if spread across 1,000 servers/network edge entry points, becomes a 1k data stream at each server/entry point, which can be ignored. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig07">Figure 21-7</a> is used to illustrate.</p>

The network, AS65003 is connected to the router B, C, and D. The network, AS65005 is connected to the router D, E, and F.</p>

        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig07"></a><strong>Figure 21-7</strong> <em>Dispersing a DDoS attack</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig07">Figure 21-7</a>, AS65000 has six entry points, each feeding a separate server (or set of servers).</p>
        <p class="indent">Assume the attacker has IoT devices scattered throughout AS65002 that are being used to launch an attack. Due to policies within AS65002, the DDoS attack streams are forwarded into AS65001, and thence to A and B. It would be easy to shut down these two links, forcing the traffic to disperse across five entries rather than two (B, C, D, E, and F). If you split the traffic among five entry points, it may be possible to eat the traffic. Each flow is now less than one-half the size of the original DDoS attack, perhaps within the range of the servers at these entry points to discard the DDoS traffic.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_577"></a>However, this kind of response plays into the attacker’s hand, as well. Now any customer directly attached to AS65001, such as G, will need to pass through AS65002, from whence the attacker has launched the DDoS, and enter into the same five entry points. How happy do you think the customer at G would be in this situation? The most likely answer is <em>not very</em>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Is there another option? Instead of shutting down these two links, it would make more sense to try to reduce the volume of traffic coming through the links and leave them up. To put it more shortly, if the DDoS attack is reducing the total amount of available bandwidth you have at the edge of your network, it does not make a lot of sense to reduce the available amount of bandwidth at your edge in response. What you want to do, instead, is reapportion the traffic coming in to each edge so you have a better chance of allowing the existing servers to discard the DDoS attack.</p>
        <p class="indent">One possible solution is to prepend the Autonomous System (AS) path of the any-cast address being advertised from one of the service instances. Here, you could add one prepend to the route advertisement from C and check to see if the attack traffic is spread more evenly across the three sites. However, this isn’t always an effective solution. Further, if this is an anycast service, the address space cannot be broken up into smaller bits. So what else can be done?</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a way to do this with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): using communities to restrict the scope of the routes being advertised by A and B. For instance, you could begin by advertising the routes to the destinations under attack toward AS65001 with the NO_PEER community. Given that AS65002 is a transit AS (assume it is for this exercise), AS65001 would accept the routes from A and B but would not advertise them toward AS65002. This means G would still be able to reach the destinations behind A and B through AS65001, but the attack traffic would still be dispersed across five entry points, rather than two. There are other mechanisms you could use here; specifically, some providers allow you to set a community telling them not to advertise a route toward a specific AS, whether the AS is a peer or a customer. You should consult with your provider about this, as every provider uses a different set of communities, formatted in slightly different ways; your provider will probably point you to a web page explaining its formatting.</p>
        <p class="indent">If NO_PEER does not work, it is possible to use NO_ADVERTISE, which blocks the advertisement of the destinations under attack to <em>any</em> of AS65001’s connections of whatever kind. G may well still be able to use the connections to A and B from AS65001 if it is using a default route to reach the Internet at large.</p>
        <p class="indent">It is possible to automate this reaction through a set of scripts, but as always, it is important to keep a short leash on such scripts. Humans need to be alerted to either make the decision to use these communities or to continue using these communities; it is too easy for a false positive to lead to a real problem.</p>

        <p class="indent">Assume A is infected with a virus, making it part of a botnet; at some point, the host is going to be configured to send some stream of packets to a public server, which will then be reflected to a target machine. The botnet could instruct the host to use its actual address, but this will not work for some forms of attack. For instance, a DNS server will respond to the source address in the packet containing the DNS request.</p>
        <p class="indent">The preferred method for an attacker is this: instruct A to use a spoofed, or hijacked, address. For instance, the botnet controller may instruct A to use an address in 2001:db8:3e8:100::/64 address space because C is the attack’s target.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a somewhat simple way for B to block this spoofed traffic. When switching traffic, B can look up the route to the source address of the packet being switched. If the source address is</p>
        <p class="bullt">• Not reachable, the packet should be dropped; this is loose uRPF.</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Reachable only through some interface other than the one the packet was received on, drop the packet; this is strict uRPF.</p>
        <p class="indent">If B is configured with strict uRPF, at least on the ports to which customers are connected (such as the port that A is connected to), then traffic sourced from A, with B’s source address, would be dropped.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_579"></a>If uRPF can prevent many forms of reflection DDoS attacks, why is it not configured on every port? Strict uRPF does not work in all situations; there are many legitimate reasons why a packet may not be entering the same interface the router would use to reach the source address. The primary reason for this is dual-homing situations, where the provider installs just one route to the destination, but packets are transmitted along both routes by the actual hosts. It is also difficult to implement uRPF in a way that does not impact the performance of very high-speed links.</p>

        <p class="noindent">One of the problems with a large-scale DDoS attack is that your entire upstream link can be consumed in the attack. One solution is to signal your upstream provider to block the DDoS flows. Flowspec can be used to carry packet-level filter rules in BGP. The general idea is this: you send a set of specially formatted communities to your provider, who then automagically uses those communities to create filters at the inbound side of your link to the Internet. There are two parts to the flowspec encoding, as outlined in RFC5575bis: the match rule and the action rule. The match rule is encoded as shown in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig09">Figure 21-9</a>.</p>

        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig09"></a><strong>Figure 21-9</strong> <em>Flowspec encoding</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">There are a wide range of conditions you can match on. The source and destination addresses are pretty straightforward. For the IP protocol and port numbers, the operator sub-TLVs allow you to specify a set of conditions to match on, and whether to <em>AND</em> the conditions (all conditions must match) or <em>OR</em> the conditions (any condition in the list may match). Ranges of ports, greater than, less <a id="page_580"></a>than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, and equal to are all supported. Fragments, TCP header flags, and a number of other header information can be matched on, as well.</p>
        <p class="indent">Once the traffic is matched, what do you do with it? There are a number of rules, including</p>
        <p class="bullt">• Control the traffic rate in either bytes per second or packets per second</p>
        <p class="bull">• Redirect the traffic to a VRF</p>
        <p class="bull">• Mark the traffic with a particular DSCP bit</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Filter the traffic</p>
        <p class="indent">If you think this must be complicated to encode, you are right. This is why most implementations allow you to set pretty simple rules, and handle all the encoding bits for you. Given flowspec encoding, you should just be able to detect the attack, set some simple rules in BGP, send the right “stuff” to your provider, and watch the DDoS go away. If you have been in network engineering since longer than “I started yesterday,” you should know by now—nothing is ever this simple.</p>
        <p class="indent1"><em>If you do not see a tradeoff, you have not looked hard enough</em>.</p>
        <p class="indent">First, from a provider’s perspective, flowspec is an entirely new attack surface. You cannot let your customer just send you whatever flowspec rules it likes. For instance, what if your customer sends you a flowspec rule blocking traffic to one of your DNS servers? Or, perhaps, to one of its competitors? Or even to its own BGP session? Most providers, to prevent these types of problems, will apply any flowspec-initiated rules to just the port connecting to your network directly. This protects the link between your network and the provider, but there is little way to prevent abuse if the provider allows these flowspec rules to be implemented deeper in its network.</p>
        <p class="indent">Second, filtering costs money. This might not be obvious at a single link scale, but when you start considering how to filter multiple gigabits of traffic based on deep packet inspection sorts of rules—particularly given the ability to combine a number of rules in a single flowspec filter rule—filtering requires a lot of resources during the actual packet switching process. There is a limited number of such resources on any given packet processing engine (ASIC) and a lot of customers who are likely going to want to filter. Since filtering costs the provider money, it is most likely going to charge for flowspec, limit which customers can send it flowspec rules (generally grounded in the provider’s perception of the customer’s cluefulness), and even limit the number of flowspec rules that can be implemented at any given time.</p>

        <h5 class="h5" id="ch21level8"><em><strong>Using a DDoS Scrubber Appliance or Service</strong></em></h5>
        <p class="noindent">A number of appliances will use local information, along with analytics gathered from a wide range of networks, to discover and block DDoS-specific flows. These appliances can be deployed inside your network, in front of or behind your edge router, as a security device. DDoS protection services can scrub your inbound traffic, as well; <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig10">Figure 21-10</a> illustrates one way in which these services work.</p>

        <p class="indentb">There are five steps in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig10">Figure 21-10</a>:</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">1. A host, A, requests the IP address for some domain, say example.com, from a DNS server.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">2. The DNS server responds with an IP address pointing to the DDoS scrubber service, hosted in a content or service provider’s network.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">3. The host sends its traffic to the scrubber service at B.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">4. B removes any DDoS traffic, leaving just the goodput, and then tunnels the remaining traffic across the Internet to the original server, C.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">5. The server responds to the request as normal, sending the information directly back to the requesting host.</p>
        <p class="indentt">Any device that is part of a botnet will also receive the scrubber’s address as the correct one to reach the service under attack. The scrubber service is normally positioned in a network able to consume many gigabits of traffic, remove any traffic that appears to be part of a DDoS attack, and send the remaining traffic on to the original <a id="page_582"></a>server. Such scrubbing services go far beyond examining the traffic, using near-real-time information about active botnets, information from DNS queries, and other factors to determine which traffic is goodput and which is part of the DDoS attack.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev10">The OODA Loop as a Security Model</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The OODA loop was originally developed by Colonel John Byrd of the United States Air Force to help fighter pilots manage decisions quickly in life-or-death situations. While network security might seem to be far outside the realm of military aircraft, the OODA loop has proven useful in a number of different security-related (and more generally reaction-related) situations. The OODA loop consists of four steps:</p>
        </div>
        <p class="bullt">• Observe</p>
        <p class="bull">• Orient</p>
        <p class="bull">• Decide</p>
        <p class="bullb">• Act</p>
        <p class="indent">The four steps begin with the letters O, O, D, and A—hence the OODA loop. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig11">Figure 21-11</a> illustrates.</p>
        <div class="fig-heading">
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780134762814/files/graphics/21fig11.jpg" aria-describedby="Al21fig11" alt="An illustration shows the four steps of the OODA loop in a circular form." width="730" height="730"><aside class="hidden" id="Al21fig11">
        <p>The four steps are as follows: observe what, orient why, decide what, and act how.</p>
        </aside>
        </div>
        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig11"></a><strong>Figure 21-11</strong> <em>The OODA loop</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_583"></a>If you have ever heard the expression <em>you need to get inside the loop</em>, this comes from the OODA loop. The person who has the “tightest loop,” or who can move through the loop the fastest, will win the contest. In terms of network security, you must be able to get inside the threat actor’s loop to get ahead of him and to find ways to stop the attack in progress.</p>
        <p class="indent">Each of the four steps deserves a closer look.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev11"><strong>Observe</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">What should you observe, and where should you observe it? In some cases, this is the most important question to ask and the hardest to answer. Should you measure the average traffic flow across specific points in the network? The average jitter across specific points? The average delay? The number of routes in the routing table? The rate at which the routing table changes?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">The right answer is to measure everything that will give you a good feel for the day-today operation of the network—with some caution. There may seem to be little harm in acquiring telemetry data from every device and every part of the network possible, and throwing the information away after a short period of time if it does not prove useful. The realistic answer, however, is you must choose your observation points carefully, after much trial and error, and after much thought about traffic flows, failure modes, etc.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a second point hidden in observe, however: how do you know what you’re observing unless you record? As the old saying goes, “if you didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen”—and nothing is truer than this in the world of observation. There’s no point in knowing what’s happening right now unless you know what has happened in the past.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev12"><strong>Orient</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Once you’ve made a set of observations, you need to decide what it is you’re observing. Consider the simple optical illusion shown in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig12">Figure 21-12</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fig-heading">
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780134762814/files/graphics/21fig12.jpg" aria-describedby="Al21fig12" alt="Two optical illusions are shown on the left and right." width="668" height="451"><aside class="hidden" id="Al21fig12">
        <p>Illusion on the left shows multiple squares which are distorted. Illusion on the right shows multiple concentric squares.</p>
        </aside>
        </div>
        <p class="fig-caption"><a id="ch21fig12"></a><strong>Figure 21-12</strong> <em>An observational illusion</em></p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig12">Figure 21-12</a>, there are two sets of squares, one of which is imposed on a background of geometric lines. On the right, the squares are actually square. On the left, however, the squares do not look square; they appear to be distorted. What you see is often determined by the context as much as what is there. Observing, therefore, is a <em>skill</em> you can develop over time. Observing a network to understand its normal state is like any other observational skill. How can engineers develop observation skills?</p>
        <p class="indent">First, understand the operation of the network, protocols, and applications at a theoretical level. Reaching beyond the command line, and into the actual operation of the devices in the network—understanding how a router forwards packets, or how OSPF builds and processes packets, can make a huge difference in your ability to orient yourself to what you are observing.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_584"></a>Second, learning and applying models is a huge help. The reason you probably have trouble with the optical illusion in this figure is the boxes appear close to being squares, so you immediately think they must be squares. You have a “model of a square,” in your head, and when you see things close to the model, you try to make the object fit. So it is important to know a wide array of models into which any problem can fit—or, in the networking world, a wide array of models you can use to “see” protocol, application, device, and network operation. Each additional model you add to your “mental model set” allows you to orient yourself a bit faster.</p>
        <p class="indent">This entire process is much like orienteering. First, get the map pointing north. Then, find the features on the map matching your location, and work from there to the destination, feature by feature. Not orienting the map is failing to separate the background from the information. Not being able to see the surrounding area is failing to collect the information necessary to match the map to the reality. Not knowing the symbols on the map is failing to have enough mental models to make the match between map and reality happen.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev13"><strong>Decide</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The worst time to make any sort of decision is at 2 a.m., in the middle of a network outage, when you are under pressure to get the business back up and running. But given network outages never happen at a convenient time, how can you avoid making these kinds of decisions?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_585"></a>You can decide what you are going to decide before you must decide.</p>
        <p class="indent">This might sound a little roundabout; perhaps an example from the world of self-defense training classes would be helpful. When is the best time to decide where you are going to go if someone attacks you? Before he does so, or while he is doing so? Defensive driving is no different: it is always best to know where you would go if the car in front of you suddenly spins out, or the wheels fall off, or some other thing you might not expect to happen.</p>
        <p class="indent">This pre-decision process can be very helpful in a network environment. For instance:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• Where would you put a filter to block this particular type of traffic?</p>
        <p class="bull">• Which parallel links would you remove to kill off the positive feedback loop keeping your routing protocol from converging?</p>
        <p class="bullb">• What servers can you shut down for a time while you are trying to figure out why the data center fabric has become so hot all of a sudden?</p>
        <p class="indent">All of these decisions are choices you can make before the action starts—before you have to decide to do something. In other words, decide what you need to do so that when it comes time to do it, you will have a plan in place.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev14"><strong>Act</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">It should be easy to act once you have observed the situation, oriented yourself to what is happening, and considered the preplanned decisions you made before the 2 a.m. call that the network is down—but it often harder to act than it should be. Why?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent">First, it is often hard to believe “this is actually happening.” This is a common problem in self-defense situations; when you first encounter a problem, you do not want to adjust to the new situation. Rather, you would rather just ignore the problem and “move on with life.” This is Scrooge, in <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, saying to Marley, “there is more gravy than grave about you.” In the real world, however, this can be a very costly way to react.</p>
        <p class="indent">Second, a storm of doubts will naturally accompany the actual moment of decision. Did you really observe this particular attack? What if you are wrong—will the consequences be worse than the attack itself?</p>
        <p class="indent">The answer to both of these problems lies in the OODA loop itself. If you have staked out observation points, if you have oriented yourself against the background information you have, if you are following premade decisions made in more rational times, then acting is the right next step to take.</p>
        <p class="indent">Hone your skills, know your network, know your monitoring points, know what you are looking at, know your plan, and do it. Make your plan, and then trust your plan.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Security is not simple; it is a broad field with a lot of potholes you can step in to, often without realizing you have, in fact, just stepped into a pothole. The castle walls of firewalls and demilitarized zones (DMZs) are in the distant past. Cannons have long since been invented, and the castle walls of the older world of network engineering are just testaments to a time long gone. Threat actors are everywhere, so defense must be everywhere, as well.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev17">Review Questions</h3>
        <p class="indenthangingN">1. Find a real-life data breach; identify the threat actor, the exploit, the vulnerability, the assets, and the risks.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indenthangingN">2. While many engineers argue validating the path calculated through routing will improve the security of the traffic flowing over the path, there appear to be a number of problems with this approach, some of which are outlined in RFC5123. Explain what you think is the relationship between securing routing and securing traffic flowing through the network.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">3. RADIUS is called out as a form of AAA in the text; find one other form of AAA and briefly describe it.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">4. What is an intrusion detection system? Describe what it does.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">5. What is a data exfiltration detection system? Describe what it does.</p>
        <p class="indenthangingN">6. If unicast RPF would be effective at blocking attacks in the global Internet, why do so few providers offering transit connectivity in the global Internet deploy it?<a id="page_590"></a></p>
