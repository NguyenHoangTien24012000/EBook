        <p class="noindent">Understanding the design and operation of the transport and control plane subsystems of a network is a good start toward being a network engineer. Design involves adding several more points and integrating them into a whole. For instance, network design also involves the following tasks:</p>
        <p class="bullt">• Building security into the design and operation of a network</p>
        <p class="bull">• Using the network as a tool (where it makes sense) to help secure the attached hosts and applications</p>
        <p class="bull">• The design patterns used in network design, and where and how to apply those patterns</p>
        <p class="bull">• Resilience at a system-wide level</p>
        <p class="bull">• Choosing between the many technologies available to solve the set of problems presented by applications and business drivers (this reaches into the world of the network designer)</p>
        <p class="bullb">• How network design interacts with strategic business interests in the long term, including how the network impacts the directions the company may be able to take in the future (this reaches into the realm of the network architect)</p>
        <p class="noindent">Network design and architecture are very broad fields, far outside the scope of this book. In fact, very little has been written specifically on these larger fields—unlike the other introductory sections in this book. Be sure to consult the “Further Reading” section at the end of each chapter in this part so that the key works in this space are called out in the larger scope.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="part3lev1"><a id="page_558"></a>Three Underlying Models</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The field of design relies heavily on models and abstractions; design tends to be more of a “seat of the pants” affair, grounded in experience and a broad knowledge set. Although they have been covered in other areas of this book, it is important to keep three specific models in mind when reading these chapters on design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="part3lev2"><strong>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Many abstractions are meant to be “perfect,” in that they completely contain information within a single system. For instance, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is designed to provide what appears to be a connection between two hosts (or two applications) across a network that does not guarantee packet delivery—in order, or at all. In reality, there are many situations where the operation of the Internet Protocol (IP)—which underlies TCP, and the physical links that underlie IP—will be directly visible in the operation of TCP. The law of leaky abstractions applies to almost every type of abstraction undertaken in a network, from layering protocols, to aggregating reachability and topology information, to building an overlay network “over the top.” A lot of complexity is driven into network protocols and design through various attempts to account for state leaking outside what should be a fairly watertight abstraction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="part3lev3"><strong>The State/Optimization/Surface (SOS) Triad</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">This was originally explained in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Fundamental Concepts</a>,” and is referenced throughout the rest of the book. Much of the art of design is consciously considering this set of tradeoffs at a system level; many designs have become overly complex, and hence overly fragile, because designers tend to focus on goals rather than tradeoffs. Consider this in terms of the decision to deploy an overlay (or even what kind of overlay to deploy). Deploying an overlay certainly decreases the amount of state, and the speed at which state changes, in the resulting underlay and overlay. The overlay can inject additional state at the overlay layer to use resources more efficiently (as an example, see <a href="ch25.xhtml#ch25">Chapter 25</a>, “<a href="ch25.xhtml#ch25">Disaggregation, Hyperconvergence, and the Changing Network</a>,” on network function virtualization). But introducing a second control plane and an “over the top” transport layer also creates a broad, and often deep, interaction surface. Will deploying the overlay ultimately increase overall complexity, or reduce it? What can be done to mitigate this additional complexity? Where will the underlay, as an abstraction, leak? What steps might need to be taken to stem this leak, and how much more complexity will this add?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="indent"><a id="page_559"></a>Every design discussion, every design decision, needs to be driven by asking questions like these about tradeoffs.</p>
        <div class="heading">
        <h4 class="h4" id="part3lev4"><strong>The Consistency/Accessibility/Partitioning (CAP) Triad</strong></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The CAP theorem is widely known and appreciated in the database design field, but is not often considered in the world of network design. In reality, CAP tells the designer that there is a time cost to distance and processing. The more distance and processing separating a data source from the ultimate data destination, the more time it will take for the data to get there. When decisions are dependent on the presence of data, this means that distance and processing requirements will ultimately slow down the pace at which decisions can be made. Hence, the ideal situation is where decisions are distributed to the point closest to where the data required to make the decision “lives”—this is known as the subsidiarity principle. The key point to remember is the source of the data; the source of business policy is the business, so decisions about policy need to be close to the business. On the other hand, the source of routing information to find loop-free paths is the network devices that have near-real-time access to the state of topology and reachability in the network, so it makes sense to put decisions based on topology changes close to the network devices that actually forward traffic.</p>

        <p class="indent">The chapters in <a href="part3.xhtml#part3">Part III</a> assume all of these factors need to be considered in each design realm; knowing and applying them will speed your capabilities as a network designer. The chapters in this part include:</p>
