        <p class="noindent">In the past, having multiple CPUs in one computer was not the norm. Only high-end server-class machines had the architecture to take advantage of multi-CPU processing. It used to be expensive to run a server with multiple CPUs, lots of RAM, and a big hard drive. This has changed thanks to developments in microprocessor technology and computer architecture that have led to prices becoming more affordable.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The development of microprocessor technology has seen incredible growth. A single-CPU architecture has evolved to a single CPU with multiple cores. A <a id="ch12key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo124"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>core</strong></span></a> is an independent processing unit that is responsible for reading and executing program instructions. So, instead of having multiple physical CPUs, a single integrated circuit can contain two or more processors and their associated local caches. A <a id="ch12key2" href="glossary.xhtml#glo80"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>cache</strong></span></a> is a block of memory that is set aside for temporary storage of information.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">core</p>
        <p class="box-para">An independent processing unit that is responsible for reading and executing program instructions</p>

        <p class="box-para">A block of memory that is set aside for temporary storage of information</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Much like a multiple-CPU architecture, a multicore CPU can execute more than one independent instruction at a time, thereby allowing for true multitasking. A multicore processor is not limited to only the server platform. In the mid-2000s, desktops, laptops, and workstations started to ship with dual-core processors. CPUs have become more affordable, and computers today ship with multicore CPUs. If you are in the market for a computer today, you are like to buy one whose processor has four or more cores.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Also in the mid-2000s, the market started to see a shift from 32-bit CPUs to 64-bit CPUs. In the past, 64-bit CPUs were used mostly in supercomputers and high-end servers. The 64-bit architecture allowed supercomputers and servers to compute twice as many data bits in the same clock cycle. Another big advantage of the 64-bit architecture is the maximum supported RAM. The 32-bit architecture can support only up to 4GB of RAM, whereas the 64-bit architecture can theoretically support 16 exabytes (EBs). This is significant for servers because they can run more programs and support more users at the same time. Overall, the 64-bit architecture provides faster and better performance than the 32-bit architecture.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Operating systems also have evolved to take full advantage of the 64-bit architecture. 64-bit operating systems are readily available. Even personal operating systems like Microsoft Windows now ship with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Currently, most operating systems are standardized on CPU platforms such as Intel and AMD and on 32-bit and 64-bit hardware architectures. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and even Mac operating systems can all run on the Intel 64-bit platform. This is an extraordinary convergence, considering where they were in the past.</p>
        <p class="noindent">All these developments in technology have paved the way for virtualization. <a id="ch12key3" href="glossary.xhtml#glo664"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Virtualization</strong></span></a> is a technology concept that involves creating a virtual computer. This virtual computer can contain but is not limited to a virtual CPU, virtual operating system, virtual storage, virtual network card, virtual firewall, virtual router, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_680"></span>virtual NIC (vNIC). A virtual computer—called a virtual machine (<a id="ch12key4" href="glossary.xhtml#glo668"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>VM</strong></span></a>), guest VM, or <a id="ch12key5" href="glossary.xhtml#glo238"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>guest machine</strong></span></a>—can live inside a physical machine—called a <a id="ch12key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo251"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>host machine</strong></span></a> or virtual host. The virtual host machine can spawn as many guest machines as its physical hardware or platform can allow. A key idea behind virtualization is that the CPU and memory are often underutilized; they are not always tasked with processes to execute. It is extremely common to see the CPU in idle state, not being used by any program. This is more common in personal computers than in servers; computers spend more time in an idle state than in an active state.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Virtualization</p>
        <p class="box-para">A technology concept that involves creating a virtual computer</p>

        <div class="box">

        <p class="box-para">A physical machine</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">When a computer’s CPU is idle, in most circumstances, the rest of the hardware—such as RAM, disk I/O, and the NIC—stays idle as well. Virtualization takes advantage of this concept and uses virtualization software to carve out enough CPU processing time, enough RAM, and enough disk space to create a virtual machine within a host machine. The number of active guest machines depends on how powerful the host machine is. (Note that when a guest machine is shut down, it requires only storage space and no other computing resources.)</p>
        <p class="noindent">The software used to provide virtualization is referred to as a <a id="ch12key7" href="glossary.xhtml#glo264"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>hypervisor</strong></span></a>. It provides a virtual machine manager (<a id="ch12key8" href="glossary.xhtml#glo669"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>VMM</strong></span></a>) for managing and controlling the underlying physical hardware and associated virtual hardware.</p>

        <p class="noindent">There are two types of hypervisors:</p>

It is sometimes called a bare-metal hypervisor. Some well-known Type 1 hypervisors are VMware’s vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft’s Hyper-V, Linux KVM, Red Hat’s Enterprise Virtualization, and Citrix’s XenServer.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch12key10" href="glossary.xhtml#glo646"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Type 2 hypervisor</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> This type of hypervisor, which is commonly used on personal computers, is loaded on an operating system and abstracts the virtualization layer through its host operating system. It is sometimes called a hosted hypervisor. Some well-known Type 2 hypervisors are VMware Workstation, Oracle’s VirtualBox, VMware Fusion for Mac, and Parallels for Mac.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Type 1 Hypervisor</p>
        <p class="box-para">A hypervisor that is loaded directly on hardware to abstract the hardware to the virtualization layer; commonly used on servers</p>

        <p class="noindent">It used to be that when an organization needed a server, a dedicated server with the right CPU and the right amount of RAM and hard drives would be identified and purchased. The specifications also depended on the functions or services the server would perform. For example, a database server would need to have more memory than a file server, whereas a file server would need to have more storage space.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Virtualization is a more cost-effective way to provide server management and maintenance. Instead of buying different servers for different services, an organization can purchase only one server. For example, a server with two 18-core processors, 24 units of 32GB RAM, and four 6TB hard drives will yield the computing resources of 36 processors, 768GB of RAM, and 24TB of storage space. This server will have enough computing resources to provision many powerful <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_681"></span>virtual servers serving different functions. When a virtual server needs more resources in the future, more CPU and RAM can be assigned to it, and more disk space can be provisioned for it. This is all done via the virtualization software, which is more convenient than opening up the physical unit to upgrade CPU, RAM, and hard drives.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An additional benefit of virtualization is that it reduces the physical footprint of a server. The number of physical servers decreases, which reduces the space used in the data center, which helps reduce the power consumption and heat dissipation requirements.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Skeptics of virtualization argue that it presents a single point of failure. Having multiple and critical virtual machines running on one physical server could indeed present a great risk. Every good IT person has been taught not to put all the eggs in one basket. Virtualization software vendors have responded to this problem by introducing a feature that makes it possible to move a live virtual machine from one physical server to another. In the event that a physical host server fails, all the virtual machines can be moved to a designated host server. Many vendors have implemented this concept, using different names. VMware calls it <a id="ch12key11" href="glossary.xhtml#glo670"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>vMotion</strong></span></a>, Citrix calls it <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo670"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>XenMotion</strong></span></a>, and Microsoft calls it <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo670"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Live Migration</strong></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">For individual VM guest machines, taking snapshots is another best practice recommendation for disaster recovery in virtualization. A snapshot of a VM is a copy of the current state of a VM at a particular instant in time. A snapshot, which can be created while the VM is in operation, can be used later to roll back a VM to a previous states—the state for which the snapshot was made. Snapshots can be saved and archived for later use, in much the same way as backup images. Microsoft renamed its Hyper-V snapshots to Hyper-V checkpoints starting in Windows Server 2012 R2.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Because a hypervisor can contain multiple guest VMs, there must be a virtual network for them to communicate. Network functions virtualization (NFV) involves the virtualization of network components. The virtual network works using a similar concept to the physical network: Whereas there are physical network switches to connect physical network devices, in a virtual network, there are virtual switches connecting guest VMs and establishing connections between the virtual network and the physical network. An example of NFV is virtual switches (or vSwitches), which can be created inside a VM host. There are two types of virtual switches:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Standard virtual switch (vSwitch):</strong> This is a typical virtual switch, dedicated to one specific host VM; it must be managed from that host VM.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Distributed virtual switch (dvSwitch):</strong> Unlike vSwitches, dvSwitches can span multiple host VMs, connecting their virtual networks together. dvSwitches evolved from the distributed switching concept, where the switch forward plane is separate from the control plane, allowing the switch fabric to span multiple locations. A dvSwitch needs to be able to communicate with its central control plane.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
        <p class="note-t"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_682"></span>Note</p>
        <p class="note-para">When talking about virtual servers and virtual networking, there may be confusion or misunderstanding regarding the term <em>virtual IP address</em>. A VM’s IP address is not referred to as a virtual IP address; rather, it is just called an IP address. A virtual IP (VIP) address is an IP address created to be shared by a group of network devices. A VIP address is purposely created as a floating IP address to be used with network proxy techniques like Port Address Translation (PAT) and in high availability technologies like load balancing and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">The personal computing world has also gained some benefits from virtualization. It used to be that if you wanted to run two or more operating systems simultaneously, you needed to own multiple computers. Today, personal desktops or laptops often have 64-bit multicore CPUs, 4GB of RAM or more, and more than 500GB of disk space. With a Type 1 hypervisor installed, you can run virtual machines of Windows 10, Windows 7, and even Linux at the same time on the same physical computer. Better yet, Mac users can enjoy running virtual machines of Windows and Linux on Mac hardware.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Not everything is designed or allowed to be virtualized, however. A prime example is macOS. No hypervisor at this time is capable of virtualizing macOS. This is not a technical issue because macOS can run on Intel CPUs, just like other operating systems. Rather, Apple has strict licensing restrictions that prohibit running macOS on non-Apple-labeled hardware.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another example of something that cannot be virtualized is software that requires an attached piece of physical hardware, called a <em>dongle</em> or <em>hardware key</em>, in order to work properly. In addition, certain systems that require extreme I/O performance, like backup servers, or high-performance computing, like supercomputers, should not be virtualized.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_692"></span><span class="space">12-3</span> Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The word <em>cloud</em> is such a nontechnical term that when it represents a technology, it sounds vague and nebulous. Cloud computing has been one of the most talked-about technologies in recent years. The term has been thrown around a lot by IT people and users alike (“People can connect to the cloud,” “my stuff is stored on the cloud,” “I migrate everything to the cloud”). The cloud is magically in the middle of everything. Yet people still don’t know what and where the cloud really is. Its famous existence has contributed to many punch lines and created many questions. The bottom line is that <a id="ch12key13" href="glossary.xhtml#glo106"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>cloud</strong></span></a> is just another name for Internet-based services. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has provided the following technical and official definition:</p>
        <p class="noindentn">Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Cloud</p>
        <p class="box-para">Another name for the Internet</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">To better understand what the cloud really is, perhaps we should explore outsourcing. <a id="ch12key14" href="glossary.xhtml#glo436"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Outsourcing</strong></span></a> means obtaining goods or services from an outside source rather than an internal source. When a company outsources a service, it means that someone outside the company has been hired to perform that work or service. In the computing world, if you outsource your IBM mainframe administration to company A, then company A will be responsible for having someone either remotely or locally manage your IBM mainframe system, which is housed on your premises.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Outsourcing</p>
        <p class="box-para">Obtaining goods or services from an outside source rather than an internal source</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A cloud service is referred to an <em>outsourced service</em>, but the service is not hosted on the local premises, and it does not run on on-premises hardware. With cloud computing, a cloud company is responsible for providing users with a service, and the service can be hosted on the cloud company’s hardware and software, which can be anywhere on the Internet.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch12key15" href="glossary.xhtml#glo107"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Cloud service/cloud computing</strong></span></a> is an outsourced and hosted computing environment that delivers IT services to users via a network. It adds the hosting element to outsourcing. This hosting element typically contains features such as self-service, automation, and application catalogs. This means end users can manage the service directly, or the administrators of the organization that uses the cloud can provision services for users. Two cloud-based services that have been around for some time are email hosting and web hosting.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Cloud Service/Cloud Computing</p>
        <p class="box-para">An outsourced and hosted computing environment that delivers IT services to users via a network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">These hosting services have been quite popular because typical users do not want to run their own email servers or web servers. It is much more economical and convenient for them to subscribe to these services. For example, cloud-based email service is offered for free to the public; Google offers gmail.com email accounts, Microsoft offers outlook.com email accounts, Yahoo offers yahoo.com email <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_693"></span>accounts, and Apple offers me.com and icloud.com email accounts. Any user can simply create an email account with such a service, and as long as the email username is not being occupied, the user can have it. Even though web-hosting services are typically not offered for free, they have become popular for small business and personal websites. For a small monthly fee, you can run a website with a design chosen from available templates. These services often offer users add-ons like database, shopping cart, or picture gallery options.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Cloud-based services are now being offered to enterprise-level organizations for a subscription price. Consider an email service, for example; instead of maintaining its own email system, a company can offload its email operations to a cloud service provider. And it is very likely to do so because running an enterprise email service involves much more than bringing up a couple of email servers. Many details have to be thought through, from design to implementation to procurement.</p>
        <p class="noindent">If a company handles its email inhouse, email administrators and server administrators need to work together to procure the servers. The size and number of the servers depend on the number of users and their mailbox sizes. In addition, the potential growth of the system must be considered. Because email is critical to every organization, the email system must be designed for high availability as well as high performance and throughput. Typically, this means multiple servers spread throughout multiple data centers. Then, the underlying infrastructure—including the network and storage—has to be considered so that the system can provide the availability that an email system needs. After the system is implemented, support and maintenance are required; someone has to maintain the system; software and the operating system have to be patched and updated.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Cloud email service providers can assume all the roles and responsibilities just described. They use virtualization technology to create a virtual email system for an organization of any size. The email system can live anywhere among many data centers that are dispersed throughout a continent (or many continents for big providers). The cloud service provider is responsible for maintaining the email system, from updating to applying patches. If the system needs more memory or is running out of disk space, the cloud service provider can perform those upgrades. All this is written into the service-level agreement (<a id="ch12key16" href="glossary.xhtml#glo558"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SLA</strong></span></a>) that the organization has with the cloud service provider.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">SLA</p>
        <p class="box-para">Service-level agreement, a formal agreement typically between a service provider and a client or an end user, that defines the level of service expected from the service provider</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">An important technical point must be mentioned here: Email does not magically flow to the cloud without being directed that way. The DNS resource <a id="ch12key17" href="glossary.xhtml#glo389"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MX (Mail Exchange) record</strong></span></a> points to the incoming email servers of the organization. The MX record must be changed to the cloud email servers so that all email can be directed to the cloud servers. Manipulating DNS records is a technique often used to direct traffic to the cloud. An organization’s website can be hosted in the cloud or cloud site just by changing the DNS A record to the IP address of the cloud server or creating a DNS <a id="ch12key18" href="glossary.xhtml#glo109"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>CNAME (Canonical Name) record</strong></span></a> that points to the cloud server hostname.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Many organizations have responded to cloud computing in a positive way. Many of their services—including critical services like web, email, and enterprise resource planning (ERP)—have been migrated to the cloud. The cloud market is doing well and has captured the attention of many businesses due to its many advantages. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_694"></span>From an economic standpoint, cloud computing is a cost-effective solution. It helps reduce capital costs, technology infrastructure cost, and personnel costs.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Cloud computing has struck a chord with new businesses and small companies, as they do not have to commit excess financial resources on server hardware, software, storage, network equipment, and a data center, and they do not need to hire many knowledgeable workers to manage and maintain the systems. From an operational standpoint, cloud computing helps improve efficiency in system management and maintenance, improve availability, create disaster recovery, and increase accessibility. This relieves the company’s IT department of duties related to maintaining the systems and keeping them up-to-date, freeing up IT to spend time on other IT initiatives. With virtualization and dispersed data centers, systems are up and available to users, who are guaranteed to have access to the systems as long as they have Internet access. Every organization, big or small, needs to evaluate a cloud service at some point and decide whether a particular service would be better managed and provided from the cloud or locally.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec4">Cloud Computing Service Models</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Cloud computing can be broken down to four major service models:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Platform as a service (PaaS)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Software as a service (SaaS)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Desktop as a service (DaaS)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Data centers are fundamental parts of most IT infrastructure. Traditionally, companies owned and ran servers in their data center on-premises. To expand their data centers offsite or for disaster recovery purposes, many companies used collocation, with their servers hosted in a shared facility run and operated by a third party. (Note that the function of a data center differs from the function a collocation facility, where a business can rent server space and sometimes other computer and network hardware.) <a id="ch12key19" href="glossary.xhtml#glo282"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong></span></a> goes further, virtualizing the facilities and infrastructure in the data center and the abstraction layer that exists on top of the physical facilities and infrastructure.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A service that focuses on the facilities and infrastructure in the data center and the virtualization and abstraction layer that exists on top of the physical facilities and infrastructure</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">IaaS allows for more effective sharing of the underlying physical resources. It encompasses the computing power of servers, storage, network elements, power, and cooling—instead of running servers in the company’s data center. It allows an organization to create virtualized servers in the cloud or to virtualize its servers and move its server systems and data center infrastructure to the cloud. This option helps eliminate or reduce the footprint of the on-premises data center. This category of cloud computing is the fundamental and underlying layer of other cloud categories. With on-demand provisioning of different resources in IaaS, infrastructure as code (IaC) has been used to manage or provision this type of cloud IT infrastructure. IaC is a software model that provides the infrastructure configuration and its needed resources in code, configuration files, or templates. The infrastructure <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_695"></span>can be efficiently deployed and its resources can be provisioned via the IaC method. Some examples of IaaS are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h5>
        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch12key20" href="glossary.xhtml#glo461"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong></span></a> focuses on application development on any desired platform using cloud computing. It incorporates platform elements such as operating systems, databases, programming languages, and middleware installed on top of the abstracted infrastructure. PaaS allows developers to design, test, and implement software on the same platform that their clients will use in a quick, simple, and cost-effective manner. This category of cloud computing service is popular among software developers for web applications and mobile applications as it allows them to frequently change or upgrade platform elements and helps them collaborate on projects. Some examples of PaaS are Google App Engine, Heroku, and Salesforce.</p>
        <div class="box">

        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Software as a Service (SaaS)</h5>
        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch12key21" href="glossary.xhtml#glo572"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong></span></a> focuses on application delivery. It provides the applications that run on top of a platform and the abstracted infrastructure, delivered via the Internet. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser, although some require plug-ins to be installed. Because SaaS eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual computers, it is easy for organizations to streamline their product delivery, maintenance, and support. This category of cloud computing is the most widely used. Email and collaboration tools are among the popular SaaS applications. Some examples of SaaS are Microsoft Office 365, Google Apps, Cisco Webex, and Citrix GoToMeeting.</p>

        </div>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Recently, another cloud-based service that has gained big momentum is <a id="ch12key22" href="glossary.xhtml#glo145"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>desktop as a service (DaaS)</strong></span></a> . DaaS is based on virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), which provides a standard way for many organizations to deliver virtual desktops to users from their data center servers. DaaS is a desktop virtualization service hosted by a cloud provider. The provider manages back-end resources such as the desktop operating system, storage CPU, and network. Virtual desktops are delivered to end users over the Internet.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A desktop virtualization service hosted by a cloud provider</p>

        <div class="note">
        <p class="note-t">Note</p>
        <p class="note-para">Virtual desktop is not to be confused with remote desktop. Virtual desktop uses virtualization to deliver a dedicated virtual host to an end user. Remote desktop, on the other hand, provides a remote desktop connection for an end user to connect to a host computer and to run the host computer remotely. Remote desktop is a popular feature with Windows. Windows uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to allow users to connect to desktops and servers. Also, a Windows server can be configured as a remote desktop gateway to manage and provide RDP services to connect remote computers.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Advantages of Cloud Computing Service Models</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Cloud computing service models provide three important benefits:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch12key23" href="glossary.xhtml#glo534"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Scalability</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> Scalable system infrastructure is designed to accommodate larger workloads while retaining consistent performance.

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec5">Cloud Infrastructures</h4>
        <p class="noindent">IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS use different types of cloud infrastructures. These infrastructures offer different levels of security, resource restrictions, and management. These are the most notable cloud models:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Public cloud:</strong> This cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by the cloud service company and made available for general public use.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Private cloud:</strong> This cloud infrastructure is operated by an organization and made available only to members of that organization.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Community cloud:</strong> This cloud infrastructure offers two or more organizations exclusive access to the infrastructure and computing resources. These organizations may share common policies that allow them to operate in a distributed mode.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Hybrid cloud:</strong> This cloud infrastructure offers a combination of at least one private cloud and one public cloud.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Cloud services have caught on because they make service provision extremely effective. Cloud provisioning is often more effective than the current provisioning process in most organizations. For example, bringing up a database server in an organization would traditionally involve many IT groups—perhaps a database administration (DBA) group, a storage group, a server administrator group, and a network group. It takes a considerable amount of effort to bring up a server, including the operating system and the database. The database server then needs to be on the assigned VLAN with the right firewall rules. This whole process might take up to a week in normal operations A cloud service provider (CSP) can accomplish the same process in moments and can serve thousands of clients.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Automation and integration are integral to cloud service provision. Cloud service providers use virtualization automation software to provision a server with specific requirement sets, carve out storage space, automate the database installation, and set up the network connectivity according to needed TCP/IP protocols and bandwidth requirement. All this happens behind the scenes, transparently to users. This automation has been driven by software-defined technologies, which involve using software to control the functions of a system by using virtualization to abstract and automate the workloads or resources. The most talked-about software defined technology is software-defined networking (SDN), which allows a network to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_697"></span>programmable and provide automated and on-demand delivery of the network-level infrastructure. In the nutshell, SDN consists of three different layers:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Application layer:</strong> This is a software program that communicates with the control layer.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Control layer:</strong> Controllers interact with both the application layer and infrastructure layer.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Infrastructure layer:</strong> This layer consists of network devices such as switches, wireless access points, and routers.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">With SDN, the industry is moving toward separating the data plane, which forwards and carries user data traffic, from the control (or management) plane, which performs administration, management, and access control functions. With this separation, these two planes do not share the same process or even the same CPU in many cases. Configuration changes to network devices can be orchestrated and deployed from the central control/management plane. SDN uses automation software to perform a network task or function. SDN then uses orchestration to automate many arranged tasks to complete a process or a workflow.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) is another software-defined technology in networking. It is similar to SDN but focuses on providing connectivity for geographically dispersed locations in a scalable and secure way. Another technology is Stratum, which is an open-source switch operating system for software-defined networks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Integrating systems and data with cloud service providers is not without negatives. Importantly, cloud computing has many inherent security implications. An organization and its cloud providers must take responsibility for different elements of security. Their responsibilities depend on the scope of cloud services provided and the agreements between them. Each party’s responsibilities should be defined clearly in an SLA. Also, if an organization must comply with regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the cloud providers must be compliant as well. Both GLBA and PCI DSS are discussed in <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>, “<a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Codes and Standards</a>.”</p>

        <p class="noindent">The enterprise environment no longer just deals with data inside individual computer hard drives. It now deals with central repository storage systems that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_699"></span>house huge amounts of business information, critical data, company databases, and all sorts of digital information. Storage is a critical IT infrastructure. An enterprise storage system is built for business continuity, with redundancy and backup, as well as for performance and scalability. A storage area network (<a id="ch12key26" href="glossary.xhtml#glo531"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SAN</strong></span></a>) is a typical enterprise storage solution. It is not a typical file server with a lot of disk drives or disk arrays. A SAN is block-level data storage located across a network.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">SAN</p>
        <p class="box-para">Storage area network, block-level data storage located across a network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Another example of block-level data storage is a hard drive. A SAN behaves just like a bunch of hard drives or disk arrays on a network, which servers and devices can access as though the SAN were locally attached disk space. A SAN consolidates multiple disk arrays together and uses LUNs (logical unit numbers) to reference different sets of specific storage in a SAN. Dedicated LUNs are then assigned to servers as if they were locally attached disk space. A SAN is typically deployed on its own dedicated network and requires a lot of bandwidth and speed to move data between the storage arrays. The following are some widely deployed storage technologies used in a SAN:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch12key27" href="glossary.xhtml#glo211"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Fibre Channel (FC)</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> This is the original high-speed technology used to connect data storage to servers. As the name implies, the technology uses fiber-optic cables to connect the storage devices into a Fibre Channel network. Every participating device has its own Fibre Channel interface. There may be a Fibre Channel switch connecting these devices in a large deployment. The latest Fibre Channel generation, generation 7, which was introduced in late 2018, can deliver 64Gbps and 256Gbps (4 lanes of 64Gbps) throughput.</p>

        <p class="box-para">The original high-speed technology used to connect data storage to servers</p>
        </div></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch12key28" href="glossary.xhtml#glo280"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>InfiniBand (IB)</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> This technology provides high performance and high throughput with low latency, which makes it a leading technology in interconnecting supercomputers. Much like Fibre Channel, InfiniBand uses its own proprietary interface for connecting devices and storage. The InfiniBand data rate called EDR (Extended Data Rate) was introduced in 2014 and is capable of providing a data rate of 100Gbps. A 2017 data rate addition to InfiniBand is HDR (High Data Rate), which has the fastest storage interface, with a speed of 200Gbps.</p>

        <p class="box-para">A technology that provides high performance and high throughput with low latency</p>
        </div></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE):</strong> This technology encapsulates Fibre Channel packets and sends them over a 10Gbps or higher Ethernet LAN. The advantage of this technology is that there is no need for a specialized Fibre Channel interface. Fibre Channel can communicate via a 10Gbps NIC. The maximum Fibre Channel frame size is 2148 bytes, which is bigger than the standard Ethernet maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of 1500 bytes. In order to pass the Fibre Channel frames without breaking them down, it is recommended to enable the jumbo frame function on the switch ports. A jumbo frame size can be up to 9216 bytes and is supported by most Gigabit Ethernet switches.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (</strong><a id="ch12key29" href="glossary.xhtml#glo307"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>iSCSI</strong></span></a><strong>):</strong> This technology enables the SCSI protocol (which has been around a long time for connecting computers with SCSI devices) to communicate over IP networks. The iSCSI protocol uses TCP ports 860 and 3260. Its speed varies depending on the network.</p>

        </div></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_700"></span>Another type of storage that has gained popularity and is much cheaper to deploy than a SAN is network attached storage (<a id="ch12key30" href="glossary.xhtml#glo390"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>NAS</strong></span></a>). Unlike a SAN, a NAS is not a block-level data storage device; it is a file-level storage device that can be accessed on a network. A NAS device has its own Ethernet connection and IP address. A NAS can share its files with multiple clients on a network. Computers can connect to a NAS via protocols like SFTP, SMB, NFS, or AFP. Connecting to a NAS is sometimes referred to as “mapping a network drive.”</p>
