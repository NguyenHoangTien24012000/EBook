        <p class="noindent">An enterprise network is vulnerable to many types of network attacks. While network attacks can’t be prevented, you can take steps to minimize the impact an attack has on a network. This chapter provides an overview of network security.</p>
        <section>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev1sec1"><span class="space">11-1</span> Introduction</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The first type of attack examined in this chapter is intrusion, where an attacker gains access to a remote network system. There are many ways an attacker can gain access to a network, including social engineering, password cracking, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_593"></span>packet sniffing, vulnerable software, and viruses. These issues are examined in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec2">Section 11-2</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec2">Intrusion: How Attackers Gain Control of a Network</a>.” The goal of a denial-of-service attack is to prevent services to a machine or network from working. This can be accomplished by flooding a network with lots of data packets or by hacking vulnerable software. For example, a particular software package might reboot if a certain sequence of data packets is sent to the host computer; this is a common problem because many software packages have this vulnerability. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec3">Section 11-3</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec3">Denial-of-Service</a>,” examines denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Techniques for using security software and hardware such as firewalls to protect a network are examined in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec4">Section 11-4</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec4">Security Software and Hardware</a>.” This section discusses the role of stateful firewalls in protecting a network. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec5">Section 11-5</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec5">Managing Network Access</a>,” examines trusted sources more closely and explores the concepts and techniques used to identify trusted sources, grant access to trusted sources, and manage trusted source accessibility. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec6">Section 11-6</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec6">Router Security</a>,” examines router security. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec7">Section 11-7</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec7">Switch Security</a>,” examines switch security. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec8">Section 11-8</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec8">Wireless Security</a>,” examines wireless security. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec9">Section 11-9</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec9">Remote Access and VPN Technologies</a>,” examines both remote access and VPN technologies. The chapter concludes with <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec10">Section 11-10</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec10">Physical Security</a>,” which provides a brief overview of physical security for a networking facility.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11tab01">Table 11-1</a> outlines the CompTIA Network+ objectives related to this chapter and identifies the chapter section that covers each objective. At the end of each chapter section you will find a review with comments on the Network+ objectives presented in that section. These comments are provided to help reinforce your understanding of each Network+ objective. The chapter review also includes “Test Your Knowledge” questions to help you understand key concepts before you advance to the next section of the chapter. At the end of the chapter you will find a complete set of questions as well as sample certification exam-type questions.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Hackers use many techniques to gain control of a network (see <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig01">Figure 11-1</a>). A network administrator needs to be aware of the various ways an intruder can gain network access and even control. A hacker already knows all the information presented in this chapter, and a network administrator needs to know it, too, to protect a network.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch11key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo571"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Social engineering</strong></span></a> is a method intruders use to get enough information from people to gain access to a network. For example, an attacker may call a network user and claim to be from the computer support division for the network. The attacker tells the user there is a problem with the user’s account and asks for the user’s username and password (see <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig02">Figure 11-2</a>). The user may blindly provide the information, not realizing that the person calling is not associated with the network and is in fact an attacker. Based on the user’s information, the attacker now has an account from which to attack the network. This is just one example of social engineering. Attackers may also search through discarded trash to gain access to user passwords.</p>

        <p class="box-para">A process by which an intruder obtains enough information from people to gain access to a network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">As the number of users increases, so do the possible ways to attack the network. It is important to educate users about not sharing information on how they access the network and always requiring identification from support staff.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another form of social engineering is shoulder surfing. As the name implies, shoulder surfing involves an attacker looking over a victim’s shoulder to steal valuable information that the victim is entering into a computer or other device. The information can be a password, a PIN, credit card information, a Social Security number, or some other piece of sensitive information. Shoulder surfing can be thwarted with the use of special screen filters and user awareness training.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Social engineering tactics can also be used to gain access to physical facilities. For example, with tailgating, an intruder gains access to a facility or restricted area by sneaking in after an authorized person has opened the door to the area. This is done without consent and awareness of the authorized person. Piggybacking is similar to tailgating, but with the consent and the awareness of the authorized person.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Phishing is probably the most infamous kind of social engineering. It involves tricking a user into giving out credentials by redirecting the user to a fake website—for a bank account or email account, for example—that requires the person’s username and password. Typically, phishing propagates through emails that ask users to click a link within the email that takes them to a phishing website.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec2">Password Cracking</h4>
        <p class="noindent">If an attacker has access to a user’s network but can’t get the password from the user, the attacker may try <a id="ch11key2" href="glossary.xhtml#glo445"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>password cracking</strong></span></a>. This can be done via brute-force or by checking for weak passwords. Most networks require users to use strong passwords and have policies specifying password complexity and length. Most operating systems support strong password policies. Avoiding common passwords is very important in preventing network intrusion.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Password Cracking</p>
        <p class="box-para">An attack in which the attacker tries to guess a user’s password</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">In password cracking, an attacker may try to guess the user’s password. One method for doing so is a <a id="ch11key3" href="glossary.xhtml#glo153"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>dictionary attack</strong></span></a> (see <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig03">Figure 11-3</a>), which involves using known passwords and many variations (uppercase and lowercase and combinations) to try to log in to an account. This is why many network systems prompt you not to use a dictionary word as a password. In a <a id="ch11key4" href="glossary.xhtml#glo73"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>brute-force attack</strong></span></a>, the attacker uses every possible combination of characters for the password. Some attackers use a combination of brute-force and dictionary attacks.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The password cracking scenario can also extend to a wireless network as an attacker may perform WPA/WEP/WPS attacks to try to gain access to a wireless LAN. Cracking encrypted systems requires an attacker to collect information. For example, a lot of information is transmitted with 802.11 packets in a wireless system. An attacker can use this information to extract the WEP key from this data. It is not simple but can be done.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_597"></span>The following guidelines can help prevent password cracking:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Don’t allow passwords that are dictionary words.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Don’t allow a user to use their username as a password—or their username spelled backward.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Limit the number of login attempts.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Require that passwords be strong, which means they are sufficiently long (no less than eight characters) and include a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols (for example, Ab1&amp;G25hamxYmx).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Require that passwords be changed often.</p></li>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec3">Packet Sniffing</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Another way attackers can obtain a password is by sniffing the network’s data packets. An attacker must be able to see network data packets in order to conduct <a id="ch11key5" href="glossary.xhtml#glo440"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>packet sniffing</strong></span></a>. The attacker has to insert a device on the network that enables her to see the data packets (see <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig04">Figure 11-4</a>). The attacker then watches the data packets until a Telnet or FTP data packet passes (or a packet from one of the many of the other applications that have unencrypted logins). Many of these applications pass the username and password over the network in plaintext (that is, in human-readable form). If the attacker captures all data packets from a user’s computer, the chances are good that the attacker can obtain the user’s login name and password on one of the network’s computers. The way to prevent this is by encrypting the username and password. An encrypted alternative to Telnet is Secure Shell (SSH). The packets that pass across an SSH connection are encrypted. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an encryption protocol used by web servers. For example, the packet transmission is encrypted with SSL when a credit card number is entered. There is also a secure version of FTP called Secure FTP (SFTP).</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_598"></span>SSL is the predecessor to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which is the most current and widely used security protocol. However, people still refer to both SSL and TLS as the SSL protocol. TLS is designed to ensure privacy between communicating parties. TLS ensures that no third party can eavesdrop on or tamper with any messages between a server and a client. TLS requires that both the client and the server use certificates to verify their identities. SSL certificates have to be signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) in order to be trusted by SSL-type applications. Web browsers should report untrusted SSL certificates or security certificate errors. When a website’s SSL certificate is untrusted, an untrusted SSL certificate could be a result of many factors. One common issue or factor is that the SSL certificate may have expired. Another is that the SSL certificate may be self-signed by the server rather than by a trusted CA.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a variation of the SSL protocol that provides the same type of security features as SSL, including integrity, authentication, and confidentiality, but it uses the UDP protocol.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Tunneled Transport Layer Security (TTLS) is similar to TLS in that it also ensures privacy, but it does not require that each party be issued a certificate. Instead, only the authentication server is issued a certificate. The client authentication requires a password, but the password credentials are transported in a securely encrypted tunnel that is established based on the server certificate.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In these examples, the security is implemented at the application layer. Security can also be implemented at layer 3, using IP Security (<a id="ch11key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo302"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>IPsec</strong></span></a>). With IPsec, each packet is encrypted prior to transmission across the network link. IPsec is also used to encrypt VPN tunnels (see <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec9">Section 11-9</a>).</p>

        <p class="noindent">Many network attacks are based on packet sniffing techniques where they require proper physical placement on the network in order to capture packets and to perform an attack. Some packet sniffing or sniffing attacks are:</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec5">Vulnerable Software</h4>
        <p class="noindent">In the process of writing large amounts of code, errors happen that can open access to the code and to a network. An attack that capitalizes on such errors is a <a id="ch11key11" href="glossary.xhtml#glo74"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>buffer overflow</strong></span></a>. A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to put more data into a buffer than it was configured to hold, and the overflow writes past the end of the buffer and over adjacent memory locations. The program stack contains data as well as instructions that it runs. Say, for example, that a program includes a variable size of 128 bytes. It is possible that the programmer didn’t include instructions to check the maximum size of the variable to make sure it is smaller than 128 bytes. An attacker will look through pages and pages of source code, searching for a vulnerability that allows her to issue a buffer overflow. The attacker finds the variable and sends data to the application assigned to that variable. For example, a web application could have a vulnerability with long URLs assigned to a variable within it. If the attacker makes the URL long enough, the buffer overflow could allow her code to be placed in the stack. When the program counter gets to the inserted code, the inserted code is run and the attacker gains remote access to the machine, as illustrated in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig05">Figure 11-5</a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_600"></span>Sometimes buffer overflows don’t allow instructions to be run but rather cause an application to crash. This type of overflow is used in denial-of-service attacks. A common way that attackers use buffer overflow attacks is to set up a <em>backdoor</em> to gain entry into a computer. The attacker creates an application on a port and then connects to the port. The attacker can also use the backdoor to place viruses on the computer. For example, say that an attacker, using vulnerability scanning software, finds a vulnerability in the source code for an operating system, such as the SSL code on a web server. The attacker downloads malicious code onto the server and then connects to the machine and instructs the code to begin attacking other machines.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec6">Preventing Vulnerable Software Attacks</h4>
        <p class="noindent">To prevent vulnerable software attacks, it is important to keep software patches and service packs for the operating system current and to update software regularly.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Also, it is important to disable unused ports. Turn off all services and ports that are not needed on a machine. For example, if a machine does not use web service, turn off this service. Leaving unused services on is like leaving the windows and doors to your house open: You are just inviting an attacker to come in. If you aren’t using a service, shut off access to it. You can use the command <a id="ch11key12" href="glossary.xhtml#glo395"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>netstat -a</strong></span></a> to display the IP ports currently open on the Windows operating system. This command shows who is connected to a machine and the port numbers. This is an important step for maintaining port security. The following is an example of using this command:</p>

The following example shows that Chrome web browser was used to establish the connection:</p>

        <p class="box-para">The command used to display the executable involved in creating a connection or listening port</p>

        [chrome.exe]
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">The ports that are listening are just waiting for a connection. For example, ports 135 and 137 shown in the preceding <strong>netstat -a</strong> example are the NetBIOS and file sharing ports for Microsoft. Every port that is established shows the status <strong>LISTENING</strong>, and each one can accept a connection. For example, if an application is vulnerable and is listening, then the machine is vulnerable to an attack. It is good idea to check which applications are running on a machine. And again, it is a good idea to turn off ports that are not needed. The steps for turning off ports depend on the application. For example, if port 80 (HTTP) is running, you can go to the Windows services and turn off the web application.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An excellent security tool that runs on Linux as well as Windows and macOS is <a id="ch11key14" href="glossary.xhtml#glo409"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>nmap</strong></span></a>. You can install this application on Linux by using the command <strong>yum install nmap</strong>, if it’s not already installed. A network administrator can use this port scanner to scan a local computer or other computers internal to the network to determine what network ports and services are being made available to users. For example, the command <strong>nmap localhost</strong> can be entered to scan the Linux machine named <strong>localhost</strong><em>.</em> <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig06">Figure 11-6</a> shows the results of such a scan. The scan shows that FTP, Telnet, SMTP (email server), SunRPC (network file server), and X11 (the GUI for Linux) are all available. Notice that each service has a port number assigned to it. (Port numbers are introduced in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5">Interconnecting the LANs</a>.”) For example, FTP is on port 21 and is running TCP. Telnet is running on port 23 and is also running TCP. A network administrator may decide that the FTP service or the non-secure Telnet service is a security threat and needs to be disabled. It is important to always disable unnecessary services.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A network/system administrator faces many important issues, but security should be the top concern. When you go out to install a new service or are maintaining existing systems, the most important issue is the system security, which involves preventing outside threats. You need to fully understand the implications of installing software and how its installation can possibly affect the overall network. The following is a list of some questions to consider when installing software:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Who will be the users of the software, and what applications are they going to be running?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Will the users need special permissions?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Will the software being installed require a firewall?</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Does the software introduce any security threats?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Another type of testing that can help protect a network is <a id="ch11key15" href="glossary.xhtml#glo453"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>penetration testing</strong></span></a>. A penetration test helps evaluate the security of a network. It is accomplished by trying to exploit vulnerabilities in the network, including identifying any potential problems with the operating systems, services, and applications as well as verifying user adherence to policies. Penetration testing also validates any protection mechanisms that are currently in place.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A <a id="ch11key22" href="glossary.xhtml#glo142"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>denial-of-service (DoS)</strong></span></a> attack is an attack in which service is denied to a computer, network, or network server. Denial-of-service attacks can be made against individual machines, on a network that connects machines, or on all machines simultaneously.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Denial-of-Service (DoS)</p>
        <p class="box-para">An attack in which service is denied to a computer, network, or server</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A denial-of-service attack can be initiated by exploiting software vulnerabilities. For example, a software vulnerability might permit a buffer overflow, causing a machine to crash. This affects all applications, even secure applications. A vulnerable software DoS attack affects a system by making it reboot repeatedly. DoS attacks can also occur on routers via the software options available for connecting to a router. For example, SNMP management software is marketed by many companies and is supported by many computer platforms. Many SNMP packages use similar core code that could contain the same vulnerability.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another denial-of-service attack is a SYN attack. This refers to the TCP SYN (synchronizing) packet (introduced in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>, “<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">TCP/IP</a>”). With a SYN attack, the attacker sends many TCP SYN packets to a host, opening up many TCP sessions. The host machine has limited memory set aside for open connections. If all the TCP connections are opened by the SYN attack, other users cannot access services because the connection buffer is full. Most current operating systems take countermeasures to prevent SYN attacks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Denial-of-service attacks can affect network bandwidth and the endpoints on a network. The classic example is a smurf attack, which requires few resources from the attacker. The attacker sends a small packet and gets many packets in return. The attacker picks a victim and an intermediate site. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig08">Figure 11-8</a> shows a smurf attack with an attacker site, an intermediate site, and a victim site. The intermediate site has subnets 10.10.1.0 and 10.10.2.0. The victim is at 10.10.1.0. The attackers send a packet to 10.10.1.255, which is a broadcast address for the 10.10.1.0 subnet. The attacker then spoofs the source address information, making it look as if the packet came from the victim’s network. All the machines on the 10.10.1.0 subnet send a reply to the source address. Remember that the attacker has spoofed the source address, so the replies are sent to the victim’s network. If this attack were increased to all the subnets in the 10.0.0.0 network, an enormous number of data packets would be sent to the victim’s network. Such an attack enables an attacker to generate a lot of data traffic on the victim’s network without requiring the attacker to have many resources.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This type of attack is not new, and you can take certain steps to stop a network from becoming an intermediate site. Cisco routers have an interface command that blocks broadcast packets to a subnet. This prevents a network from becoming an intermediate site for a network attack such as this. Make sure this command or a similar command is a default or has been enabled on the router’s interface:</p>
        <pre class="pre1"><strong>no ip directed-broadcast</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">Aren’t layer 3 devices supposed to stop broadcasts? This is true for general broadcasts (all 32 bits set to 1s or F F F F F F F F or 255.255.255.255). Routers always stop such broadcasts. The type of broadcast used in this attack is a <a id="ch11key23" href="glossary.xhtml#glo155"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>directed broadcast</strong></span></a>, which is passed through the router. The <strong>no ip directed-broadcast</strong> command enables only the router to reply.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Some DoS attacks are truly malicious. For example, a <a id="ch11key24" href="glossary.xhtml#glo454"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>permanent DoS (PDoS)</strong></span></a> attack is a very malicious type of attack that aims to sabotage hardware and render it useless. A PDoS attack can damage a hardware system to the point that it requires replacement or reinstallation. However, not all DoS attacks have malicious intent; some are friendly and unintentional. A friendly/unintentional DoS is typically caused by heavy legitimate traffic to a server or a website that inadvertently overwhelms the server resources or the network connection. The server or network cannot handle the massive volume of traffic, and users are likely to experience unresponsive service.</p>

        <p class="box-para">A malicious attack that aims to sabotage hardware and render it useless</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">To prevent a network from becoming a host for an attacker, you can use access lists to allow only specific sources from the network to enter the router’s interfaces. For example, say that network B connects to a router. Only packets sourced from network B are allowed to pass through the router. The downside of this is that it becomes a maintenance problem: Keeping track of the access lists can be challenging for a network administrator, and processing access lists on the router is processor intensive and can slow the throughput of the packets. However, using access lists does help eliminate spoofed packets. An attacker may <a id="ch11key25" href="glossary.xhtml#glo578"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>spoof</strong></span></a> by not using his IP address but instead inserting an IP address from the victim’s network or another network as the source IP address. A lot of software on the Internet enables people to spoof IP addresses.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Spoof</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_608"></span>A <a id="ch11key26" href="glossary.xhtml#glo497"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>reflective/amplified DoS attack</strong></span></a> is an attack that is carried out using spoofing and that is a combination of a reflection attack and an amplification attack. The attacker spoofs the victim’s IP address and sends requests to many different servers or devices that respond to that type of request. The devices all then reply back to the victim’s IP address, which is unable to process the overwhelming amount of traffic.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Reflective/Amplified DoS Attack</p>
        <p class="box-para">An attack that is carried out using spoofing and that is a combination of a reflection attack and an amplification attack</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A recent type of reflective/amplified DoS attack uses DNS servers that are configured as open resolvers on the Internet. Attackers spoof a victim’s IP address and send a small DNS zone transfer query request for a list of open DNS servers; the servers respond with a huge zone transfer list (hence <em>amplified</em>). These amplified responses are then sent back to the victim, overwhelming the victim’s resources. Much like DNS amplification attacks, some reflective attacks use public Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers. In this case, a botnet sends the old NTP remote command <strong>monlist</strong>, requesting a list of the last 600 hosts that were connected to the server, and spoofs the source IP address to be the victim. Again, this DoS attack is used to overwhelm the victim and bring down the system.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Deauthentication Attack</p>
        <p class="box-para">An attack in which an attacker sends a frame to the wireless access point with a spoofed address to make it look like it came from the victim, resulting in the access point disconnecting the victim’s connection from the AP</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Another notable DoS attack using a spoofing technique is a wireless <a id="ch11key27" href="glossary.xhtml#glo138"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>deauthentication attack</strong></span></a>. An attacker sends a deauthentication message to the wireless access point (AP) with the victim’s MAC address, resulting in the access point disconnecting the victim’s connection from the AP.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The only way to truly prevent yourself from becoming a victim of a denial-of-service attack is to avoid ever being connected to any network or to any other users. That’s really not practical today. However, there is a way to detect attacks and to minimize their impact. Some security appliances, discussed in the next section 11-4, can help prevent and mitigate these types of attacks. Also, you can set a <em>honeypot</em>, a staged computer system or environment that is specifically set up with security vulnerabilities open for attacks. It is used to gain information about attacks and sometimes can draw attacks away from an actual critical system.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec10">Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The number of packets that can be generated by a single packet (as in a smurf attack) can be limited on a router; however, attackers now use worms to distribute attacks. In a <a id="ch11key28"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</strong></span></a> attack, the attacker does a port scan and looks for an open port or a software application that is vulnerable to attack. The machine is <em>hacked</em> (attacked) and distributes the malicious software. The attacker repeats this for many victim machines. After the software is on the victim machines, the attacker can issue a command or an instruction that starts the attack on a specific site. The attack comes from a potentially massive number of machines the worm has infected.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">DDoS</p>
        <p class="box-para">Distributed denial-of-service attack</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Typically, DDoS attacks are deliberate; they are considered to be coordinated attacks. A <a id="ch11key29" href="glossary.xhtml#glo122"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>coordinated attack</strong></span></a> is a type of DDoS attack that is deliberately directed against a specific target and orchestrated by a controller source such as the command-and-control server in a botnet. In recent news, the Anonymous group has been synonymous with these coordinated attacks and has planned many attacks to deliberately bring down websites to send a political message. A botnet is a prime example of coordinated DDoS. A <em>botnet</em> is a group of infected or compromised computers on the Internet that are used to launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks against another system on the network. A botnet computer is controlled via an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel by a server called a command-and-control server.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A healthy network starts from within, and the most basic component in a network is an individual computer. An individual computer should have protection similar to that of its network. Remember that the fundamental goal of DDoS is to take control of vulnerable machines and launch an attack. This can be prevented. Even though it is not cost-effective to guard each computer with dedicated hardware, there is a plethora of security software that can help.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec13">Personal Firewalls</h4>
        <p class="noindent">One type of software protection that is readily available for a computer is a personal firewall. Most operating systems today (Windows, macOS, and Linux) are equipped with personal firewalls, although these firewalls may not be enabled by default. Personal firewall software is typically based on basic packet filtering inspections, where the firewall accepts or denies incoming network traffic based on information contained in the packets’ TCP or IP headers. Some personal firewalls provide more granular control to allow specific hosts or subnets. Some personal firewalls also offer an application-based firewall, where trusted programs can be defined. In this case, the firewall allows network traffic originated from or destined to the trusted programs.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In the Windows operating system world, firewall protection has evolved from being a simple firewall in Windows XP to allowing more granular control in Windows 10. The Windows 10 firewall enables both packet filtering and an application-based firewall. In addition, the firewall software has both inbound and outbound control. In the Linux world, <strong>iptables</strong>—a network packet filtering firewall program—has been a de facto firewall program for a long time. The recent macOS deploys PF (Packet Filter) as its OS firewall. PF is a BSD-based stateful packet filter firewall. The following sections demonstrate how to configure firewall settings for Windows 10, macOS, and Linux.</p>

        <p class="note-para">Incorrect host-based firewall settings can result in network issues or loss of network connectivity for a computer. It is a good idea to create a firewall rule and try it out—and to do this with only one rule at a time.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec14">Antivirus/Anti-malware Software</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The first line of defense against viruses, worms, and general malware is antivirus/anti-malware software. Recommended practice is to have an antivirus program installed on every computer. Even though antivirus/anti-malware software cannot provide 100% protection, it does protect against most viruses.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_611"></span>Antivirus software matches <em>signatures</em> or <em>definitions</em> against viruses and worms. Each virus or worm has its own traits, which are defined in a signature or a definition. When a new virus or worm is found, a new signature or definition has to be created. Most of the commercial antivirus companies have new signatures/definitions ready and available for their customers to download within hours of the spread of new malware. This is why it is important to keep antivirus software up-to-date. Most antivirus software is launched at the startup of the operating system, and it tries to update its signatures or definitions at that time. When a virus is found on a computer, the virus program is usually quarantined or removed. Popular antivirus software is available from Microsoft, McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro, Sophos, and AVG.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch11key30" href="glossary.xhtml#glo212"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Firewalls</strong></span></a> are used in computer networks for protection against the network elements (such as intrusions and denial-of-service attacks). An <a id="ch11key31" href="glossary.xhtml#glo12"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>access control list (ACL)</strong></span></a> is a basic form of firewall protection, although an access list is not stateful and is not by itself a firewall. ACLs can be configured on a router, on a true dedicated firewall, or on a host computer for restricting access to the computer and the network.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Firewall</p>
        <p class="box-para">Hardware or software used to protect a computer network</p>

        <p class="box-title">Access Control List (ACL)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A basic form of firewall protection</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">An access list consists of permit and deny statements to control traffic into and out of the network interface. There is an implicit denial at the end of an access list in Cisco routers, and this statement alone blocks all data packets. In order to allow other data packets that do not match the ACL’s permit and deny statements to enter and exit the LAN, the command <a id="ch11key32" href="glossary.xhtml#glo14"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>access-list permit ip any any</strong></span></a> must be added to the last line of an access list to explicitly allow all other data packets. If the intention is to deny other data packets that match the permit statements, then the explicit permit statement is not needed. In the following example, the instruction is for access list 100, and it tells the router to deny IP packets from a host with IP address 192.168.9.2 to any destination and to permit IP packets from any source to any destination:</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">access-list permit ip any any</p>
        <p class="box-para">The instruction added to the last line of an access list to allow all other data packets to enter and exit the router</p>

        <pre class="pre1">RouterB(config)# <strong>access-list 100 deny ip host 192.168.9.2 any</strong>
        RouterB(config)# <strong>access-list 100 permit ip any any</strong>
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">Because an ACL is placed at a firewall’s ingress or egress interface, incorrect ACL settings cause network issues or may inadvertently allow unwanted traffic into the network. You have to be very careful when configuring ACL rules. Firewalls allow traffic from inside the network to exit but don’t allow general traffic from the outside to enter the network. A firewall monitors the data traffic and recognizes where packets are coming from. A firewall allows packets from the outside to enter <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_618"></span>the network if they match a request from within the network. Traditional firewalls are based on three technologies:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Packet filtering</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Proxy server</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Stateful packet filtering</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">In general, you want to place a firewall close to the machines you want to protect (for example, the network servers). You should not assume that the clients on the network will never attack your system. Clients can and will get viruses on their machines. It is best practice to create <a id="ch11key33" href="glossary.xhtml#glo141"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>demilitarized zones (DMZs)</strong></span></a> for the outside servers, and put them in places on the network where they are isolated. DMZ is a term borrowed from the military that refers to a buffer zone that separates a trusted internal network from the untrusted external networks. That way, if the machines are compromised, the intruder will have limited access to the inside of the network. A DMZ is also referred to as a <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo141"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>screened subnet</strong></span></a> or a <em>perimeter network</em>.</p>
        <div class="box">

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">With <a id="ch11key34" href="glossary.xhtml#glo438"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>packet filtering</strong></span></a>, a limit is placed on the packets that can enter the network. Packet filtering can also limit information moving from one segment to another. ACLs are used to enable a firewall to accept or deny data packets. Packet filtering has some disadvantages:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Packets can still enter the network by fragmenting the data packets.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">It is difficult to implement complex ACLs.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Not all network services can be filtered.</p></li>

        <p class="box-para">Protection in which a limit is placed on the information that can enter the network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A network administrator also has the option of configuring IP exclusions by using the firewall settings. This can be beneficial in improving the accuracy of reports.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Clients use a <a id="ch11key35" href="glossary.xhtml#glo480"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>proxy server</strong></span></a> to communicate with secure systems using a proxy. The client gets access to the network via the proxy server. This step is used to authenticate the user, establish the session, and set policies. The client must connect to a proxy server in order to connect to resources outside the network. Proxy servers have some disadvantages:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">A proxy server can run very slowly.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">Adding services can be difficult.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">There can be a potential problem with network failure if the proxy server fails or is corrupted.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">With a <a id="ch11key36" href="glossary.xhtml#glo584"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>stateful firewall</strong></span></a>, the inbound and outbound data packets are compared to determine whether a connection should be allowed. This includes tracking the source and destination port numbers and sequence numbers as well as the source and destination IP addresses. This technique is used to protect the inside of a network from the outside world but still allow traffic to go from the inside to the outside and back. A firewall needs to be stateful in order to accomplish this.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Stateful Firewall</p>
        <p class="box-para">A firewall that keeps track of data packet flow</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_619"></span>What if a campus network has a web server? How are outside users allowed access? Holes must be opened in the network to allow data packets to pass through. The three most common traffic types that require holes to be opened are web servers, DNS, and email. A firewall must be modified so that anybody can connect to the web server via port 80. But what if a vulnerability is discovered on port 80 for the server’s operating system? When ports are open, the network administrator must continually upgrade the software so that vulnerabilities are removed. The web server also might need to have its own firewall. Most firewalls can perform deep packet inspection, which can catch some protocol vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A firewall is usually placed inline between a trusted (internal) network and an untrusted (external) network. Its primary function is to protect the trusted network. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig18">Figure 11-18</a> shows an example of how a perimeter firewall can be deployed. A perimeter firewall is physically placed between the public Internet and the internal networks. All incoming traffic is considered untrusted and is inspected by the firewall according to its rules. Sometimes, a firewall might be connected to a campus router. A router might be needed to aggregate multiple networks or to handle more complicated network routing. At the firewall, NAT or PAT is typically configured to handle the translation between the private IP addresses and the public IP addresses.</p>
        <figure class="image" id="ch11fig18">

        <p class="noindent">A big problem with firewalls is that users assume that a firewall catches all possible problems. This assumption is incorrect. A user might be slow to update patches and fixes to software. Then, for example, an attacker might send an email message with an attachment to a user, and the user might open the attachment and unknowingly load on his computer a Trojan horse that scans all the machines on the LAN, checking for any possible open ports and compromising the entire LAN. A firewall is not an end-to-end solution.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec19">Other Security Appliances</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Many security appliances on the market today help protect networks. Most of these appliances work in conjunction with or as supplements to a firewall. <a id="ch11key37" href="glossary.xhtml#glo289"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs)</strong></span></a> both monitor and analyze network traffic. In real time, they identify misuse and anomalies on the network. They can detect intrusions by matching network packets with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_620"></span>signatures for known attacks or activities that are classified as bad. A network anomaly can be detected by building up a profile of the system being monitored and detecting significant deviations from that profile. An IDS is designed to monitor both inbound and outbound data traffic and report on any suspicious activity that could indicate an attack. An IPS has the capability to stop or prevent malicious attacks that it detects in real time by interacting with the firewall. In addition, host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) are software based. A HIDS monitors a computer system for changes such as system file modifications, changes to the registry, file changes, and system logs. HIDS software packages are configured to prevent malicious activity on the host system, and if an unauthorized change or activity is detected, an alert is issued. Based on policy settings, the central server could be notified or the activity could be blocked.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</p>
        <p class="box-para">Systems that identify misuse and anomalies on a network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Another appliance that is widely deployed is a web filter or content filter appliance. Lots of places have very strict policies on how users can use the network. Web traffic is often monitored and filtered, and a web filter appliance is designed to handle that. In the K–12 school environment, web filtering is critical. The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires K–12 school districts to implement filtering to block adult, illegal, and offensive content from minors. A web filter appliance has a database containing inappropriate websites. It monitors web traffic via HTTP and HTTPS and matches that traffic against the database. If an inappropriate website is detected, it is either discarded or the user is redirected to a security web page for further action. The web filter appliance’s database is updated perpetually. Also, there is an option for a network administrator to manually mark a website as inappropriate.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Instead of blocking unwanted traffic or content, you can use an appliance that can throttle or shape network traffic based on type, source, or destination; such a device is called a <a id="ch11key38" href="glossary.xhtml#glo439"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>packet shaper</strong></span></a>. This device sits between a campus network and the outside network. The device is set up so that all data traffic, incoming and outgoing, passes through it. The packet shaper box is configured with a set of rules that are used to prioritize data traffic. This is extremely important when it comes to managing your network’s data bandwidth/throughput. A packet shaper can be used to set rules to limit download traffic from the Internet. It can also be used to make sure applications such as VoIP are given higher priority so that their operation and quality of service are not affected.</p>

        <p class="box-para">A device that sits between a campus network and an outside network that is configured with a set of rules that are used to prioritize data traffic for shaping the bandwidth</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A relatively new firewall technology called a next-generation firewall (NGFW) combines traditional firewall functionalities with all the special network functions of network appliances, such as IPS, deep packet inspection, bandwidth control, antivirus, and malware inspection. NGFWs are sometimes also referred to as layer 7 firewalls.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An important aspect associated with security appliances is making sure IT staff are continually updated on technology and that they receive proper training. In addition, it is important to make sure critical systems are protected by a UPS and regularly backed up. Also, you should validate that the security appliances incorporate redundancy and that they will not be single points of failure.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Computers are subject to attacks, and in some cases, crimes are committed. Therefore, network technicians and network administrators must know the proper steps to take to preserve evidence. The following are some basic guidelines for first responders:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">No action should change data held on a computer or storage media that may be subsequently relied upon in court.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data held on a computer or storage media, that person must be competent to do so and must be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of the actions.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">An audit trail or some other record of all processes applied to computer-based electronic evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the same result.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The person in charge of the investigation has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">There are six stages of a forensics examination:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="num"><strong>Readiness:</strong> This includes appropriate training, regular testing, and verification of software and equipment, familiarity with legislation, and ensuring that the onsite acquisition (data extraction) kit is complete and in working order.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The evaluation process includes receiving instructions, clarifying the instructions, completing risk analysis, and allocating resources.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num"><strong>Collection:</strong> This stage involves collecting evidence and interviewing relevant personnel as well as the IT administration responsible for the affected system.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num"><strong>Analysis:</strong> This stage involves using appropriate tools to provide thorough and repeatable analysis of the compromised system.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num"><strong>Presentation:</strong> In this stage, the examiner provides a structured report on the findings of the examination. This also includes addressing key points and any additional information relevant to the investigation.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num"><strong>Review:</strong> In this stage, the examiner should review what went wrong, what was done properly, and what can be learned and improved on based on the incident.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noindent">This is only a brief overview of computer forensics and the concept of preserving evidence. A network technician should make sure a qualified forensics specialist is involved if a crime has been committed.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The previous section focuses on blocking unwanted traffic from entering a network and allowing traffic from a trusted source into the network. This section examines the concept of a trusted source more closely and explores the concepts and techniques used to identify a trusted source, grant access to a trusted source, and manage accessibility for a trusted source.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch11key39" href="glossary.xhtml#glo50"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Authentication, authorization, and accounting</strong></span></a> (<span class="gray_kt"><a><strong>AAA</strong></a></span>, pronounced “triple-A”) is a framework for controlling access to computing resources, enforcing policies, and auditing usage. AAA defines fundamental security building blocks that are the core of network management and security, as its name implies.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A framework for controlling access to computing resources, enforcing policies, and auditing usage</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Authentication defines who and what a user is. It has to happen first. Without successful authentication, there will not be authorization and accounting. This process provides a mechanism to identify a valid user. The most common practice is for a user to supply a username and password. The AAA server checks and verifies the authentication credentials. If the credentials are valid, the user is granted access to the network. If not, the authentication fails, and access is denied. A password is a common authentication factor based on something a user knows. Other authentication factors are what a user has (for example, a smart card), what a user is (for example, biometric), and what a user does (for example, handwriting).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that is widely used in enterprise environments. A Kerberos server issues a special token or ticket to its authenticated users, and it uses this ticket to validate user access to a resource or a service. This process, called single sign-on (SSO), permits a user to authenticate only once, and after successful authentication, the user is trusted to access other services or systems based on the ticket.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Authorization defines what a user is allowed to do. As the process after authentication, it governs the privileges and tasks a user can perform after gaining access to a network or system. Authorization determines whether a user has the authority to perform particular tasks or to access certain resources. For example, a user may gain access to a network switch and may only be authorized to view the switch and not to make any changes to it. As with authentication, authorization is negotiated at the AAA server, which enforces all the user access policies. Authorization based on a user’s role and responsibilities is called <a id="ch11key40" href="glossary.xhtml#glo509"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>role-based access control (RBAC)</strong></span></a>. RBAC uses the security principle of least privilege to enforce access policy at a more fine-grained level. As the name implies, the least privilege principle involves giving a user only the privileges necessary to perform a job. RBAC is a fundamental building block of a Zero Trust model, which is a newer security model in identity and access management (IAM). The Zero Trust model—whose motto is “Never Trust. Always Verify”—makes sure every access request to the IT resources is authenticated and authorized.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</p>
        <p class="box-para">Authorization based on a user’s role and responsibilities</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Accounting defines and keeps track of what users do. Simply put, this process keeps track and records all the activities by all users. While these activities can be logged by the AAA server, in most cases, they are carried out as part of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_624"></span>system log (syslog), which records and stores all the events related to the system. It is best practice to send all the accounting activities to a centralized syslog for keeping track of auditing and logging so that the events from all network devices can be monitored, analyzed, and correlated. The analytics can be used for resource planning, capacity planning, network trend monitoring, and security analysis.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Cisco offers authentication, authorization, and accounting service as a way to centrally manage and control user access for its routers and switches. AAA supports two of the most commonly used access protocols:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):</strong> The most widely used AAA protocol today is RADIUS, which was developed by Levingston Enterprise during the heyday of modem dial-ups in the early 1990s to manage users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS is now an IETF standard networking protocol that is widely used for authenticating remote users, authorizing user access, and accounting for user activities.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus):</strong> Cisco routers and switches can communicate with RADIUS or TACACS+ servers for central authentication. AAA enables local authentication based on the router’s local user database, enables line passwords, and allows other access protocol types.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Another technology that uses the AAA framework is network access control (NAC), sometimes known as network admission control. NAC is a security mechanism that can be implemented on a network to register, authenticate, authorize, and enforce security policies on all endpoint devices before they are allowed to access the network. NAC has gained popularity as a method to manage and keep track of the devices involved in a BYOD (bring your own device) policy. NAC can be deployed in many forms—hardware appliance, virtual appliance, client agent, or clientless agent. It can be used to manage the onboarding and offboarding of mobile devices. NAC typically interfaces with a RADIUS server for device authentication.</p>
        <p class="noindent">To manage network devices and resources properly, an organization must have a good policy for change management for network device configuration, as well as standard procedures for network maintenance. To prepare for disaster recovery, an organization must have a backup plan that covers backing up network equipment configurations and archiving for recovery process.</p>
        <p class="noindent">One of the most fundamental elements of network operations is documentation. Documentation can consist of network drawings and wiring diagrams, asset management, and vendor documentation. Network diagrams help engineers visualize and understand how things are connected. Asset management gives engineers details of their network equipment, from model numbers to software versions and locations.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another security device is UTM (unified threat management), which is an all-in-one solution that integrates a wide range of security features into one appliance. A UTM appliance may consist of a firewall, a network IDS/IPS, a VPN, a gateway antivirus/anti-malware, gateway anti-spam, load balancing, and content filtering. This type of appliance is popular in small to medium businesses where the network is too big and complicated. It helps reduce administrative overhead time and cost.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev1sec6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_626"></span><span class="space">11-6</span> Router Security</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Routers perform essential services for networks. A router is typically deployed at the perimeter of a network. Therefore, it is the first line of defense for the network. Compromise of a router can lead to many issues on the network, such as degrading network performance, denial of network services, exposure of network configuration details, and exposure of the sensitive data. A poorly configured router can easily become a compromised router, thereby reducing the overall security of the network and potentially exposing the internal network to scans and attacks. This section focuses on best practices for configuring a network router to avoid or prevent serious security problems.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Physical security is always at the top of the list of security best practices. A router should be placed in a secure area where it is accessible only to authorized personnel. The easiest access to a router is via its console port. Someone who gains access to the premises can easily take physical control of a router. Even a router secured with a password is not safe in the event of physical access: A router’s password can be recovered by someone who has console access. Even worse, the router can become disabled or damaged, and all network services will be halted until the situation is repaired.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The operating system of a router is another crucial component that a network administrator must keep up to date. However, the latest version of a router’s OS may have had only limited exposure to testing. Most network administrators wait before upgrading to the latest version to make sure there are no side effects or bugs. Most network administrators settle for the latest stable release of the router operating system rather than the very latest one.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Configuration hardening can limit the exposure of a router. This section focuses on configuration hardening of Cisco routers. The same concepts apply to other vendors’ routers; however, their configuration method and commands will be different.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec25">Router Access</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Local access and remote access to a router are the common ways of gaining control of a router, and such access must be restricted to only authorized personnel. A typical way of securing local access or remote access is to create a password. Two types of passwords are used on a router: the line password and EXEC (privileged EXEC) password.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The <a id="ch11key41" href="glossary.xhtml#glo327"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>line password</strong></span></a> is used to gain access to a router. This password should be used in conjunction with the command <strong>service password encryption</strong>. This global command encrypts the password and displays it in encrypted form. It is not strong encryption, but it can be used to provide low-level security.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Line Password</p>
        <p class="box-para">A password used to gain access to a router</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_627"></span>The <a id="ch11key42" href="glossary.xhtml#glo198"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>EXEC (privileged EXEC) password</strong></span></a> used to be enabled with the <strong>enable password</strong> command, but that command has been replaced by the <strong>enable secret</strong> command, which provides stronger password encryption.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">EXEC (privileged EXEC) password</p>
        <p class="box-para">A password used to gain access to EXEC commands</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Cisco IOS uses a number of password protection schemes. The command <strong>enable password</strong> is a <a id="ch11key43" href="glossary.xhtml#glo648"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Type 7</strong></span></a> protection scheme, which uses a Cisco encryption algorithm. The command <strong>enable secret</strong> is a <a id="ch11key44" href="glossary.xhtml#glo647"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Type 5</strong></span></a> protection scheme and uses the MD5 hash. MD5 is not considered secure today, so other protections schemes are commonly used. For example, Cisco Type 8 uses SHA-256, and Type 9 uses a script hash. These password protections can be enabled by using the command <strong>enable algorithm-type sha256</strong> for Type 8 and <strong>enable algorithm-type sha256</strong> for Type 9.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Type 7</p>
        <p class="box-para">A protection scheme that uses a Cisco encryption algorithm</p>

        <div class="box">

        <p class="box-para">A protection scheme that uses an MD5 hash for encryption</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A security step beyond typical password protection is to create user accounts for authorized personnel. Doing so makes it possible to track and log each time a system is accessed. You can create a local user account on a router by using the command <strong>username</strong> [<em>name</em>] <strong>privilege</strong> [<em>level</em>] <strong>password</strong> <em>[password_string</em>]:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-4a" id="pre11-4">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>username admin privilege 10 password @dm1np@$$wd</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">Cisco provides 16 levels (0 through 15) of privileges. Each level is preassigned commands that can be run. Level 15, which is the highest level, is equivalent to privileged EXEC mode. The command <strong>username admin privilege 10 password @dm1np@$$wd</strong> creates a local user called <strong>admin</strong> with privilege level 10.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The drawback of creating a local user is that the same user has to be created on every router on the network—and this is not a scalable approach. AAA, as mentioned earlier, is a framework for controlling access to computer resources AAA typically involves the use of RADIUS and TACACS+, so Cisco routers can communicate with RADIUS or TACACS+ servers for central authentication. AAA enables authentication based on the router’s local user database, enables line passwords, and other access protocols. The following example shows how to configure AAA on a Cisco router:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-5a" id="pre11-5">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>aaa new-model</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>aaa authentication login default local group tacacs+</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>aaa authorization exec default local group tacacs+ if-authenticated</strong>
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">Once the authentication method is defined, it can be applied to any access entry point, either local or remote. The local access can be via the console port or the auxiliary port. The remote access is via vty (virtual terminal). The following example shows how to configure a console port with security access. It enforces the authentication by using the local user database and a timeout of 5 minutes if the user input is not detected. Also, it prevents the remote access to the console port via reverse Telnet with the command <a id="ch11key45" href="glossary.xhtml#glo639"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>transport input none</strong></span></a>:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-6a" id="pre11-6">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>line con 0</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>login local</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>exec-time 5 0</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>transport input none</strong>
        </pre>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">transport input none</p>
        <p class="box-para">A command that prevents remote access to the console port via reverse Telnet</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Remote access to the router can be accomplished via Telnet or SSH. Telnet is a default transport protocol into a router, but its unencrypted traffic is a big security <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_628"></span>flaw. Therefore, using SSH is recommended whenever possible. Enabling SSH transport requires an extra step of generating an RSA key. To generate an RSA key, the hostname and the domain name must be preconfigured on the router; this information will be used as part of the key. To generate the key, the command <a id="ch11key46" href="glossary.xhtml#glo129"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>crypto key generate rsa</strong></span></a> is issued:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>crypto key generate rsa</strong></pre>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">crypto key generate rsa</p>
        <p class="box-para">A command used to generate an RSA key</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">After the RSA key is generated, the remote vty access can be configured with SSH as the transport. The following is an example of configuring the vty remote access with SSH:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-7a" id="pre11-7">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterB(config)# <strong>access-list 15 permit 10.10.20.0 0.0.0.255</strong>
        RouterB(config)# <strong>access-list 15 deny any</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>line vty 0 4</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>access-class 15 in</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>login authentication default</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>transport input ssh</strong>
        RouterA(config-line)# <strong>exec-time 5 0</strong>
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">This configuration uses the default login authentication defined earlier in this section. The command <strong>transport input ssh</strong> enforces SSH as the only access method. <strong>access-class 15</strong> defines the access list of the network that is allowed to connect to the router via SSH. Finally, the EXEC timeout minutes is set to 5 minutes.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec26">Router Services</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A router has many services enabled by default. These services vary from vendor to vendor. Unnecessary services should be disabled, and any services deemed necessary should be tightened. TCP/IP services such as echo, discard, daytime, chargen, bootp, finger, identd, and SNMP are enabled automatically on a Cisco router, but most of them are not needed. You can disabled them globally as follows:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-8a" id="pre11-8">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>no service tcp-small-servers</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>no service udp-small-servers</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>no ip bootp server</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>no service finger</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>no ip identd</strong>
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">Services such as echo, discard, daytime, and chargen are considered TCP and UDP small services and can be disabled using <strong>no service tcp-small-servers</strong> and <strong>no service udp-small-servers</strong>. Some services might be needed, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and HTTP. These services need to be tightened. The SNMP default community string must not be used, and the new community string must be difficult to guess. Read/write access should be avoided at all costs, and read-only access should be configured. Also, SNMP access should be restricted to certain known SNMP agents. Better yet, SNMP version 3 should be used instead. The following is an example of SNMP configuration on a Cisco router with read-only access and restricted access, as defined in access list 10:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>snmp-server community M@ke1tD1ff1cuLT ro 10</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_629"></span>Cisco IOS supports web-based remote administration, which is easier and more intuitive to use than the CLI mode that is available for Telnet or SSH. However, HTTP has no encryption. Therefore, web-based administration via HTTP can reveal passwords. Therefore, you should avoid HTTP as well as Telnet. More recent Cisco IOS software versions, starting from release 12.2(15)T, provide another option: HTTPS with end-to-end SSL encryption. The following example illustrations this option:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-9a" id="pre11-9">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>no ip http server</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>ip http secure-server</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>ip http access-class 15</strong>
        RouterA(config)# <strong>ip http authentication aaa</strong>
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">This configuration shows that the normal HTTP service is disabled, and the HTTPS service is enabled instead. HTTP access is also restricted with access list 15, and AAA authentication is enabled.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Besides disabling unnecessary services running on the router, some services or features that Cisco routers utilize should be disabled. It is recommended that services such as CDP, remote configuration downloading, and source routing be disabled, if they are not used.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Cisco devices use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) to identify each other on a LAN segment. CDP, which is enabled automatically, allows anyone on the network to collect network information. You disable CDP as shown here:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>no cdp run</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">You can disable the remote configuration by using the command <strong>no service config</strong>:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>no service config</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">This stops a router from loading its configuration from the network, which is not secure. A router is capable of loading its startup configuration from local memory, which is more secure than loading the configuration from the network.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Source routing can be used in many kinds of attacks. When you disable this feature, as shown here, the router disregards IP packets containing source route information:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">RouterA(config)# <strong>no ip source-route</strong></pre>
        <p class="noindent">On the interface level, any unused interfaces should be disabled so that they cannot participate in any network activity. Directed broadcasts allow a host on another network segment to initiate a broadcast to a different network segment. This can be used as a denial-of-service attack such as a smurf attack. This feature should be disabled. Newer IOS versions disable the directed broadcast by default.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The router interfaces should not act as intermediaries for ARP or ARP proxy. An ARP proxy extends ARP traffic between two network segments. This is not desirable and should be avoided. Also, a router can be used to relay ICMP messages that can be used by attackers, and the generation of these messages should be disabled on the interface. ICMP messages that are commonly exploited include Host unreachable, Redirect, and Mask reply. The following example shows a configuration to secure the router interface in these ways:</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch11key47" href="glossary.xhtml#glo340"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Logging</strong></span></a>, which is a critical part of security, allows an administrator to analyze events that occur and use the information on those events to correlate and find issues. Cisco routers and switches provide a great deal of logging events. These devices can log system errors, network and interface status, login access, access list matches, routing changes, and many more types of events. Cisco’s log messages can be directed to the console, terminal line, memory buffer, and syslog server. There are 8 levels (from 0 to 7) of log severity:</p>

        <p class="noindent">For best security, it is recommended that syslog logging and buffered logging at the debugging level be set up. To keep accurate logs, the correct time has to be set up on a router. This step is often skipped. Cisco routers and switches support Network Time Protocol (<a id="ch11key48" href="glossary.xhtml#glo415"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>NTP</strong></span></a>), which can be set up to synchronize a router’s clock with the time server. To correlate the time with the log events, a timestamp service needs to be initiated. The following example shows the log configuration of a Cisco router:</p>

        <p class="noindent">Switches are common network devices. Typically, there are more switches than routers on a network. The router features discussed so far in this chapter can also be found in most network switches. Some features are enabled by default, and some can be enabled manually, depending on the manufacturer. Many users treat network switches just like other plug-and-play computing devices: They think that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_632"></span>if a switch is powered on and the network device connecting to it can access the network, the switch must be working properly. This is not entirely true, though; a network administrator needs to know what switch features are enabled and disabled.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The focus of this section is on manageable Cisco switches; however, some of these concepts may apply to other switch vendors as well.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Before putting a switch into a production environment, you should know what the switch is doing and what it is capable of doing. Much as an administrator should know about a computer’s CPU speed, RAM amount, disk space, and operating system version, an administrator needs to know about a switch’s capabilities, operating system version, configuration, and running services.</p>
        <p class="noindent">On Cisco switches, you can use the simple command <strong>show version</strong> (or <strong>sh ver</strong>) to find information on the switch hardware, such as make, model, software version, switch interfaces, and system uptime:</p>

        <p class="noindent">To view the current running configuration of a switch, you can use the command <strong>show running-configuration</strong>. This command shows the current running state of the switch, as well as what features and services the switch is expected to be running. If some services or features are enabled but are not needed, they should be disabled. The commands <strong>show version</strong> and <strong>show running-configuration</strong> are basic commands that give you a good overview of a switch and a starting point for troubleshooting. After you use these commands, you should document the switch information as a best practice.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec30">Switch Port Security</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Switches are commonly used in the access layer of the network hierarchy. The access layer connects users who share common network resources and bandwidth. Directly interfacing with users can create security challenges, as there is no telling what will be connecting to the switch access ports. The more control or policy that can be enforced at the switch port level, the better off the network will be. Because switch interfaces or ports directly connect users or network equipment, they should be securely configured to prevent malicious attacks or exploitations. A fundamental security rule and best practice is to disable any unused switch ports. There are more ports on switches than on routers.</p>
        <p class="noindent">When applying the same command to a group of switch ports, you can use the <a id="ch11key49" href="glossary.xhtml#glo489"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>range</strong></span></a> command, which makes it easier to apply the same security policy on switch ports. The following example shows the commands to shut down a group or a range of interfaces:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-14a" id="pre11-14">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">SwitchA(config)# <strong>interface range Gigabitethernet1/1-24</strong>
        SwitchA(config-if)# <strong>shutdown</strong>

        <p class="box-para">A command that makes it easier to apply the same security policy on a group of switch ports</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">These commands shut down all the switch ports electronically. When someone tries to physically connect to a port, no physical link will come up. This is the easiest and quickest way to restrict physical wired access to a network. <a id="ch11key50" href="glossary.xhtml#glo5"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>802.1X</strong></span></a>, sometimes referred to as dot1x, is a more advanced technique that can be used to authenticate users to gain access to wired and wireless networks. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_634"></span>802.1X is an IEEE standard access control and authentication protocol that prevents unauthorized devices from connecting to a network through publicly accessible ports unless they are properly authenticated. With 802.1X, a switch is in communication with an authentication server, and the authentication server authenticates each device connected to a switch port before services are made available to the device.</p>

        <p class="box-title">802.1X</p>
        <p class="box-para">An IEEE standard protocol for access control and authentication; also called dot1x</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">By default, VLAN 1 is always enabled on every switch—even when no other VLANs are configured. Switches automatically carry traffic on VLAN 1, so VLAN 1 is a default native VLAN. It is recommended as a best practice to avoid using VLAN 1 but rather to create different VLANs for different purposes and to change the native VLAN to one of those new VLANs. Not only does this help prevent VLAN 1 from being exploited, it helps segregate network traffic based on type or designated group. This practice is part of the network segmentation technique, which involves creating a logical segment for ease of control and management.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Some built-in port security commands are available from many switch vendors, including Cisco. <a id="ch11key51" href="glossary.xhtml#glo602"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Switch port security</strong></span></a>, or <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo602"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>port security</strong></span></a>, can be configured to restrict a port’s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. The command to enable port security is <strong>switchport port-security</strong>, and this command has to be issued at the interface level. You can configure a switch port to restrict access by setting a maximum number of MAC addresses, or you can configure it to allow only known MAC addresses to pass traffic.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Switch Port Security (or Port Security)</p>
        <p class="box-para">Switch commands used to restrict a port’s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">To configure the maximum number of MAC addresses on a switch port, you use the command <strong>switchport port-security maximum [</strong><em>number</em><strong>]</strong>. To configure a port to allow certain MAC addresses to pass traffic, you use the command <strong>switchport port-security mac-address [</strong><em>mac_address</em><strong>]</strong> or <strong>switchport port-security mac-address sticky</strong>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">You can use the command <strong>port-security mac-address [</strong><em>mac_address</em><strong>]</strong> to manually get the configured MAC address into the running configuration. You can use the command <strong>switchport port-security mac-address sticky</strong> to automatically enter the dynamically learned MAC addresses into the running configuration. With the <a id="ch11key52" href="glossary.xhtml#glo590"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>sticky</strong></span></a> option, the configured MAC address appears in the running configuration of the switch and is saved in the startup configuration. This way, when the switch reboots, the configured MAC address remains part of the configuration. Along with the security configuration, you need to define a violation action. When a violation occurs, one of the selected violation actions—protected, restrict, or shutdown—takes effect:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>protected:</strong> This violation action drops packets from the violated MAC address(es).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>restrict:</strong> This violation action is the same as the protected mode, but it also sends SNMP trap messages to the SNMP server.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>shutdown:</strong> This violation action shuts down the port and puts the port in the <strong>ERRDISABLE</strong> state.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_635"></span>The following is an example of configuring port security to allow a maximum of only two MAC addresses per port and, if a violation occurs, to shut down the switch port:</p>

        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">When a port is in the <strong>ERRDISABLE</strong> state, manual intervention is needed to enable the port again. You need to issue the command <strong>shutdown</strong> and then <strong>no shutdown</strong> to reenable the port. Another way of reenabling a port from the <strong>ERRDISABLE</strong> state is to configure the <strong>errdisable</strong> recovery feature. The following example shows the <strong>errdisable</strong> configuration to recover a port from a port security violation after 10 minutes:</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec31">Dynamic ARP Inspection</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature that prevents ARP spoofing, which leads to ARP poisoning or ARP cache poisoning. With ARP spoofing, an attacker sends a forged ARP packet to change either the MAC or IP address information of the intended target to that of the attacker so that traffic will be forwarded to the attacker. DAI requires help from DHCP snooping (refer to <a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, “<a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Managing the Network Infrastructure</a>”). The DHCP snooping feature must be configured in order to establish the DHCP snooping database, which contains valid mappings of MAC addresses and IP addresses. To enable DAI, configure DHCP snooping and then issue the following command:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-17a" id="pre11-17">Click here to view code image</a></p>

        <p class="noindent">The switch inspects and compares all the ARP packets against entries in the DHCP snooping database. If the MAC address or IP address in an ARP packet does not match a valid entry, the packet is dropped.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec32">STP Special Features</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a very common protocol used in every network switch. STP is a layer 2 protocol designed to prevent loops within switched networks. STP builds a topology based on BPDU (bridge protocol data unit) messages. A vulnerability associated with STP is that an STP-enabled device within <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_636"></span>a network can actively change the STP topology by sending an unexpected BPDU message. To prevent such an event, features such as BPDU Guard and BPDU Filter can be used.</p>
        <p class="noindent">On STP-enabled switches, a switch port has to go through four STP states—block, listen, learn, and forward—before it can pass traffic. This process can take 30 to 50 seconds. To reduce this time, a switch port can be configured with STP PortFast, which speeds up the STP process and transitions the port into a forwarding state, bypassing the listen and learn state. Typically, an STP PortFast interface is used to directly connect a host device, which does not send BPDU messages. <a id="ch11key53" href="glossary.xhtml#glo66"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>BPDU Guard</strong></span></a> is used to prevent STP PortFast from receiving any BPDU message to modify the spanning tree topology. Upon receipt of a BPDU, BPDU Guard puts the interface configured for STP PortFast into the <strong>ERRDISABLE</strong> state. By default, BPDU guard is disabled. The following commands demonstrate how to globally enable BPDU Guard on a Cisco switch and how to configure STP PortFast on an interface:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-18a" id="pre11-18">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">SwitchA(config)# <strong>spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default</strong>
        SwitchA(config)# <strong>interface gigabitethernet 1/0/13</strong>
        SwitchA(config-if)# <strong>spanning-tree portfast</strong>
        </pre>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">BPDU Guard</p>
        <p class="box-para">An option that is used to prevent STP PortFast from receiving any BPDU message to modify the spanning tree topology</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">BPDU Guard can also be enabled at the interface level with the following command:</p>
        <p class="codelink"><a href="ch11_images.xhtml#pre11-19a" id="pre11-19">Click here to view code image</a></p>
        <pre class="pre1">SwitchA(config)# <strong>interface gigabitethernet 0/1</strong>
        SwitchA(config-if)# <strong>spanning-tree bpduguard enable</strong>
        </pre>
        <p class="noindent">BPDU Filter offers another way to deal with BPDUs. Keep in mind that BPDU Guard prevents a switch port from receiving any BPDU messages, but it does not prevent it from sending them. The BPDU Filter feature effectively disables STP on the selected ports by preventing them from sending and receiving any BPDU messages. The switch port ignores all BPDUs received and sends no BPDUs. Much like BPDU Guard, BPDU Filter can be configured globally or on an individual port. The global command is <strong>spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default</strong>. The command to enable BPDU Filter at the interface level is <strong>spanning-tree bpdufilter enable</strong>.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch11key54" href="glossary.xhtml#glo512"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Root Guard</strong></span></a> is another feature that can be used to protect the STP topology. Unlike BPDU Guard, Root Guard allows participation in spanning tree and BPDU messages as long as the attached device does not attempt to become the root bridge. Essentially, Root Guard provides a way to enforce the root bridge placement in a network. If an unauthorized device starts sending BPDU messages with a better bridge ID, Root Guard disables the switch port on which those BPDU messages were received. The switch port is in the <strong>ERRDISABLE</strong> state. The Root Guard feature can be enabled only at the interface level. It is recommended to apply this feature to switch ports that are not connected to the root bridge. The following is the command used in interface configuration mode to enable Root Guard:</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section provides an overview of securing 802.11 wireless LANs. A network administrator must be aware of security issues when configuring a wireless LAN. It is important to remember that radio frequency (RF) signals will pass through the walls, ceilings, and floors of a building even with low signal power. Therefore, the assumption should never be made that wireless data is confined to only the user’s area. A network administrator must assume that the wireless data can be received by an unintended user if the network is not secured. In other words, an unsecured wireless LAN is open to network security threats.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_638"></span>An additional issue is that RF signals used in wireless communications are open. This means that anybody who has the right type of equipment can create problems. One particular problem is called <a id="ch11key55" href="glossary.xhtml#glo313"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>jamming</strong></span></a>, in which a wireless network is overwhelmed with wireless traffic, thereby jamming the network and preventing authorized users from accessing the network.</p>

        <p class="box-para">A problem in which a wireless network is overwhelmed with wireless traffic, thereby preventing authorized users from accessing the network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">To address threats to WLAN security, a network administrator must ensure that the WLAN is protected by firewalls and intrusion detection. Most importantly, a network administrator must make sure that the wireless security features are turned on. Surprisingly enough, many WLANs are placed on a network without the available wireless security features being turned on. Many times, a user in a WLAN assumes that no one would break into their computer because nothing important exists on the system. This may be true, but to an attacker, the user has one very important item: access to the wired network through an unsecured client.</p>
        <p class="noindent">WLANs use an <a id="ch11key56" href="glossary.xhtml#glo539"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SSID</strong></span></a> (service set identifier) to authenticate users, but the SSID is broadcast in radio link beacons about 10 times per second. In WLAN equipment, the <a id="ch11key57" href="glossary.xhtml#glo59"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>beacons</strong></span></a> are transmitted so that a wireless user can identify an access point to connect to. The SSID can be turned off so that it isn’t transmitted with a beacon, but it is still possible for the SSID to be obtained through packet sniffing. As discussed earlier in this chapter, packet sniffing is a technique used to scan through unencrypted data packets to extract information. In this case, an attacker uses packet sniffing to extract the SSID from data packets. Disabling SSID broadcasting makes it so most client devices (such as Windows devices and Apple devices) won’t notice that the wireless LAN is present. This at least keeps casual snoopers off the network. Enterprise-grade access points implement multiple SSIDs, with each configured SSID having its own VLAN and wireless configuration. This enables the deployment of a common wireless LAN infrastructure that supports multiple levels of security, which is important for some venues, such as airports and hospitals (where there are both public and private users).</p>

This requires that Wired Equivalent Privacy (<a id="ch11key60" href="glossary.xhtml#glo677"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>WEP</strong></span></a>) be turned on. WEP is used to encrypt and decrypt wireless data packets. The exchange and return of the encrypted text verifies that the client has the proper WEP key and is authorized to be a member of the wireless network.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">It is important to note that shared-key authentication is extremely vulnerable. As a result, it’s standard practice to avoid the use of shared-key authentication.

        <p class="noindent">It is well known that WEP is a weak wireless security system. It doesn’t use strong enough encryption to secure a wireless network. The RC4 algorithm is used for encryption in WEP. WEP has a couple of weaknesses. For one thing, challenge text in WEP is sent in plaintext. In addition, the WEP initialization vector is only 24 bits and is always static. WEP also does not use key management, and its pre-shared key never changes. Because of these factors, it is not very difficult to obtain the pre-shared key for WEP. Despite its weaknesses, WEP does provide some basic security, and using it is certainly better than operating a network with no security.</p>
        <p class="noindent">WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 provide better security than WEP. <a id="ch11key61" href="glossary.xhtml#glo693"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>WPA</strong></span></a> (Wi-Fi Protected Access) supports the user authentication provided by 802.1X and replaces WEP as the primary way for securing wireless transfers. WPA, like WEP, uses RC4 as the encryption algorithm, but it provides a key management mechanism via <a id="ch11key62" href="glossary.xhtml#glo626"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>TKIP</strong></span></a> (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol). TKIP basically generates a sequence of WEP keys based on a master pre-shared key and rekeys periodically every 10,000 packets (file integrity monitoring). TKIP also uses an integrity check value to ensure that the packet is not tampered with. If tampering is detected, WPA stops using the current key and rekeys.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">WPA2 is an improved version of WPA. It uses <a id="ch11key63" href="glossary.xhtml#glo27"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>AES</strong></span></a> (Advanced Encryption Standard) as its encryption algorithm and <a id="ch11key64" href="glossary.xhtml#glo87"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>CCMP</strong></span></a> (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) as its key management protocol. There are two versions of WPA2: WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_640"></span>WPA2-Personal authorizes wireless users using pre-shared keys, while WPA2-Enterprise authorizes wireless users via a server authentication to accommodate and manage a bigger user pool in an enterprise environment.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">WPA3, which is the latest version of WPA, provides greater wireless security for Wi-Fi-certified devices. Like WPA2, WPA3 offers both Personal and Enterprise versions. WPA3-Personal introduces Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which helps prevent dictionary attacks on the password or passphrase. SAE generates a unique key for each password attempt, tremendously slowing down brute-force attacks. WPA3-Enterpise uses 192-bit AES encryption, and WPA3-Personal uses 128-bit AES encryption with an option for 192-bit AES encryption.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An encryption algorithm and key management alone cannot truly secure a wireless connection. The 802.1X standard enhances wireless security by incorporating authentication of the user. The original authentication framework was Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). There are a variety of EAP standards. Cisco Systems uses an 802.1X authentication system called <a id="ch11key65" href="glossary.xhtml#glo323"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>LEAP (Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol)</strong></span></a>. With LEAP, the user must enter a password to access the network. This means that if the wireless client is being used by an unauthorized user, the password requirement will keep the unauthorized user out of the network. EAP-FAST (EAP-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunnel) is another Cisco-proprietary EAP standard developed to overcome some vulnerabilities found in LEAP. For non-Cisco standards, EAP-TLS (EAP-Transport Layer Security) was the original and universally used wireless authentication standard. PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) was developed by Microsoft, Cisco, and RSA Security. PEAP is widely supported by wireless vendors and is becoming the authentication standard to use. PEAP, EAP-TLS, and EAP-FAST do not require client certificates. EAP-TLS requires a client-side certificate.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">WPA is considered to be a higher level of security for wireless systems. In the 802.1X system, a user requests access to the wireless network via an access point. The next step is for the user to be authenticated. At this point, the user can only send EAP messages. Extensible Authentication Protocol (<a id="ch11key66" href="glossary.xhtml#glo175"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>EAP</strong></span></a>) is used in WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 by the client computer and the access point. The access point sends an EAP message requesting the user’s identity. The user (client computer) returns the identity information that is sent by the access point to an authentication server. The server then accepts or rejects the user’s request to join the network. If the client is authorized, the access point changes the user’s (client’s) state to authorized. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (<a id="ch11key67" href="glossary.xhtml#glo488"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>RADIUS</strong></span></a>) is sometimes used to provide authentication. This type of authentication helps prevent unauthorized users from connecting to the network. In addition, this authentication helps keep authorized users from connecting to rogue access points or unauthorized access points.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Another way to further protect data transmitted over a WLAN is to establish a VPN connection. Doing so protects data from attackers. The following are basic guidelines for wireless security:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">Make sure the wireless security features are turned on.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">With the popularity of Wi-Fi hotspots, there has been a big increase in war driving and war chalking. <a id="ch11key68" href="glossary.xhtml#glo674"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>War driving</strong></span></a> is a process in which attackers search for locations with open or weak wireless networks so that they can gain more access to the network and collect information or data from connecting users. <a id="ch11key69" href="glossary.xhtml#glo673"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>War chalking</strong></span></a> involves leaving marks or symbols on the premises, outside the premises, or online to notify other hackers about the wireless vulnerabilities of the location.

        <p class="noindent">Bluetooth is not an 802.11 technology, but it is part of the 802.15.1 standard, and it suffers from exploitations similar to those that plague 802.11 wireless devices. Some notable Bluetooth exploits are Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing. Bluejacking is considered to be more annoying than harmful as it involves sending unsolicited text messages to other Bluetooth devices in the vicinity. Bluesnarfing is truly an attack to gain unauthorized access of another Bluetooth device over the Bluetooth connection with the intention of obtaining information stored on the Bluetooth device.</p>

For example, what is the cost/benefit ratio for increased security? How will incorporating or not incorporating increased wireless security affect users? A network administrator needs to make some important decisions regarding wireless security before it is installed and the network becomes operational.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section addresses the technologies used to facilitate remote access to a network. It includes an overview of analog, digital, and hybrid techniques used for establishing remote network connections. This section covers many of the broadband technologies that can be used, some of which are still prevalent in rural areas where the latest newer technologies like fiber-to-the home (FTTH) are not available. In fact, many areas of the United States are still struggling to get high-speed broadband connections to residential homes. It is therefore important to understand these technologies and their evolutions.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This section covers the limitations of modem connections and discusses the V.92/V.90 standard (for hybrid connections). Next, this section examines high-speed access using high-speed cable modems and high-speed remote digital access using DSL. This section concludes with the last piece needed for remote access: the remote access server.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec37"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_643"></span>Analog Modem Technologies</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Analog modems were a breakthrough technology that paved the way for many other broadband technologies. Thanks to modems, voice frequency (analog) channels of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) can be used for the transmission of digital data.</p>
        <p class="noindent">To transport data over analog channels, the data must be converted to an analog form that can be sent over the bandwidth-limited voice-grade channels. On voice-grade telephone lines, bandwidth is limited by transformers, carrier systems, and line loading. Each of these factors contributes to attenuation of all signals below 300Hz and above 3400Hz. While the bandwidth from 300Hz to 3400Hz is suitable for voice transmission, it is not appropriate for digital data transmission because the digital pulse contains <em>harmonics</em> (higher frequencies) that are well outside this range. Transmitting data via a phone requires the conversion of a signal to fit totally within the 300Hz–3400Hz range. This conversion is provided by a modem.</p>
        <p class="noindent">There were several major modem standards for providing high-speed modem connections to analog telephone lines. <a id="ch11key70" href="glossary.xhtml#glo659"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>V.44/V.34</strong></span></a> is totally analog and supports data rates up to 33.6Kbps, and <a id="ch11key71" href="glossary.xhtml#glo660"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>V.92/V.90</strong></span></a> is a combination of digital and analog and supports data rates up to 56Kbps. A V.92/V.90 modem connection requires a V.92- or V.90-compatible modem and an Internet service provider (ISP) that has digital line service to the phone company. The data transfer with V.92/V.90 is called <a id="ch11key72" href="glossary.xhtml#glo47"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>asymmetric operation</strong></span></a> because the data rate connection to the service provider is typically at V.34 speeds, whereas the data rate connection from the service provider is at the V.92/V.90 speed (56Kbps). The difference in the data rates in asymmetric operation is due to the noise introduced by the analog-to-digital conversion.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The old-style modem link from your computer to the PSTN (your telephone connection) is typically analog. This analog signal is converted to digital at the phone company’s central office. If the ISP has a digital connection to the phone company, an analog-to-digital conversion is not required. However, the signal from the ISP through the phone company is converted back to analog for reception by your modem. The digital-to-analog process does not typically introduce enough noise to affect the data rate. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig20">Figure 11-20</a> shows the digital–analog path for V.92/V.90.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The modem dial-up connection was considered to be the first out-of-band management for networks. A company would use a dedicated dialup modem to connect to the network or network devices. This out-of-band connection provided an alternative to dedicated access to the network to manage the network equipment. In contrast, traditional in-band management involves using a LAN to manage network equipment.</p>

Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (<a id="ch11key74" href="glossary.xhtml#glo165"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>DOCSIS</strong></span></a>) is an international standard that enables high-speed data transfer over the cable system. Cable modems capitalize on their high-bandwidth network to deliver high-speed two-way data. Data rates range, on average, from 128Kbps to 200Mbps upstream (from the computer to the cable headend) and from 10Mbps to 1000Mbps downstream (from the cable headend to the computer). Cable modem connections can also be one-way when the television service implemented on the cable system precludes two-way communication. In this case, the subscriber connects to the service provider via the traditional telephone and receives the return data via the cable modem. The data service does not impair the delivery of cable television programming. Currently, cable systems use the Ethernet protocol to transfer data over the network. Many subscribers use the same upstream connection. This leads to potential collision problems, so a technique called <a id="ch11key75" href="glossary.xhtml#glo491"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ranging</strong></span></a> is used. With ranging, each cable modem determines the amount of time needed for its data to travel to the cable headend. This technique minimizes the collision rate, keeping it to less than 25%.</p>

A filter is required for all telephone connections to eliminate noise interference any time a computer is in use on the connection.</p>

        <p class="noindent">When a network is protected behind a firewall, it is sometimes referred to as a <em>private</em> network. Only computers on the same private network are considered to be trusted. Public access to this kind of network could be very limited. Access to a private network requires that special permission be granted on the firewall. Imagine a sales company that has its sales workforce throughout the country. The salespeople need to access the company’s servers and databases at company headquarters, which is protected behind a firewall. It would be a network administrator’s nightmare to have to grant individual access through the company’s firewall. This type of setup would not allow for flexibility and mobility. A virtual private network (<a id="ch11key81" href="glossary.xhtml#glo671"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>VPN</strong></span></a>) offers a solution to this problem. As the name implies, a VPN extends a private or trusted network over public infrastructure like the Internet. A VPN accomplishes this by establishing a secure connection between the remote end and the private network (private VLAN), therefore enabling the remote clients to become part of the trusted network. A network appliance that is designed to manage a secure VPN connection is called a <em>VPN concentrator</em>. A VPN concentrator is essentially an advanced router or a dedicated appliance that has been enabled to handle multiple VPN connections (VPN tunnels) into a network and hence acts as a <a id="ch11key82" href="glossary.xhtml#glo672"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>VPN headend</strong></span></a>.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec42">VPN Tunneling Protocols</h4>
        <p class="noindent">This section provides a quick overview of the protocols used in the creation of VPN tunnels. One of the original tunneling protocols is Generic Routing Encapsulation (<a id="ch11key87" href="glossary.xhtml#glo236"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>GRE</strong></span></a>), which was developed by Cisco in 1994 and is still being used today. GRE is commonly used as a site-to-site VPN solution because of its simplicity and versatility. It is the only tunneling protocol that can encapsulate up to 20 types of protocols. In the past, when protocols such as AppleTalk, Novell IPX, and NetBEUI roamed the network, GRE was the tunneling protocol of choice to carry these protocols to other remote sites.</p>

        <p class="box-title">GRE</p>
        <p class="box-para">Generic Routing Encapsulation, a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco for use as a site-to-site VPN solution</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Establishing a GRE tunnel through the IP telco cloud to connect Router A with Router C requires that the source and destination addresses of the physical network connection be defined. For example, in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig24">Figure 11-24</a>, Router A connects to the telco cloud via the router’s Serial0/1 interface. The IP address 192.168.210.5 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 has been assigned to the Router A Serial 0/1 interface. Router C (the remote router) connects to the telco cloud via its Serial0/1 interface. The IP address assigned to Router C’s Serial 0/1 interface is 192.168.100.3 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. (<em>Note:</em> Any interface that connects to the telco cloud can be used to set up the VPN interface.) A tunnel is then established on each of the routers. The tunnel is assigned an IP address that is used in the home network. For example, the home network is a 10.0.0.0 network; therefore, the tunnel between Router A and Router C will have a 10.<em>x.x.x</em> IP address. The tunnel between Router A and Router C is called <em>tunnel 0</em> and is assigned IP addresses 10.10.30.1 and 10.10.30.2.

        <p class="noindent">The tunnel connection makes it appear as if remote users are part of the home network. This is accomplished by encapsulating the IP packet. The first packet uses the IP address that the remote user will use after the connection has been made. The encapsulation is used to transport the data across the networks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Let’s look at the configuration steps required on Router A and Router C to establish a GRE tunnel. In this case, you assign the tunnel 0 interface on Router A IP address 10.10.30.1. Then you need to define the IP destination and source address for the tunnel. Referring to <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig24">Figure 11-24</a>, the source IP address for tunnel 0 from Router A is 192.168.210.5, and the destination IP address for the remote interface on Router C is 192.168.100.3. After you configure the tunnel source and destination IP addresses, the router prompts that the “line protocol on Interface Tunnel0” changed state to up. The Router A configuration is as follows:</p>

        <p class="noindent">This simple example shows a point-to-point GRE tunnel being established between two routers. There are also Multipoint GRE (<a id="ch11key88" href="glossary.xhtml#glo357"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>mGRE</strong></span></a>) tunnels, in which case you have a hub site and multiple spokes. The spokes have normal GRE configuration, and the hub site has mGRE configuration. GRE tunnels are appropriate for establishing permanent VPN connections between routers for remote offices of a company. However, a remote user who travels will have to establish a VPN connection directly from his or her PC, through an ISP and the VPN server in the home network.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The tunneling protocols commonly used in remote access VPNs are mentioned throughout the rest of this section. To better understand remote access VPNs, you should at least understand the importance of Point-to-Point Protocol (<a id="ch11key89" href="glossary.xhtml#glo470"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>PPP</strong></span></a>). In the days when modems and dial-ups were common, PPP was the key to the remote <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_650"></span>access solution; it was the de facto protocol of dial-up networking. In those days, people would make a dial-up connection to their ISP and establish a PPP session to the Internet. Even though authentication is optional for PPP, most implementations of PPP provide user multifactor authentication using protocols such as Password Authentication Protocol (<a id="ch11key90" href="glossary.xhtml#glo443"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>PAP</strong></span></a>) or Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (<a id="ch11key91" href="glossary.xhtml#glo93"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>CHAP</strong></span></a>). PAP is a simple, plaintext (unencrypted) authentication method, which has been superseded by CHAP, an encrypted authentication method that uses the <a id="ch11key92" href="glossary.xhtml#glo351"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>MD5</strong></span></a> file hashing algorithm. Due to its vulnerabilities, MD5 was replaced by Secure Hash Algorithm (<a id="ch11key93" href="glossary.xhtml#glo544"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SHA</strong></span></a>), which is a secure hash algorithm required by law for use in certain government applications. It includes cryptographic algorithms and secure protocols for the protection of sensitive, unclassified information. SHA comes in several types: SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Later, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) was introduced as another PPP authentication method. During the PPP authentication phase, the ISP dial-up server collects user authentication data and validates it against an authentication server such as a RADIUS server. The RADIUS server supports many methods of user authentication, including PAP, CHAP, and EAP. Even though PPP dial-up is not as prevalent today as it once was, the concepts of central authentication still lend themselves to many technologies and applications.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (<a id="ch11key94" href="glossary.xhtml#glo471"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>PPTP</strong></span></a>) was developed jointly by Microsoft, 3Com, and Alcatel-Lucent in 1996. It has never been ratified as a standard. Microsoft was a big advocate of PPTP and made PPTP available as part of Microsoft Windows Dial-up Networking. A PPTP server was included in Microsoft NT 4.0 Server, and PPTP was widely used as a remote access solution. PPTP was designed to work in conjunction with PPP. A PPTP client software would establish a PPP connection to an ISP, and once the connection was established, it would make the PPTP tunnel over the Internet to the PPTP server. The PPTP tunnel uses a modified GRE tunnel to carry its encapsulated packet for IP transmission. <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11fig25">Figure 11-25</a> illustrates a typical PPTP connection and other tunneling protocols. PPTP does not have any authentication mechanism, so it relies heavily on the underlying PPP authentication.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (<a id="ch11key95" href="glossary.xhtml#glo315"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>L2F</strong></span></a>) was developed by Cisco around the same time as PPTP. L2F was not used widely in the consumer market due to its requirement of L2F hardware. Unlike PPTP, where the VPN client software is installed and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_651"></span>initiated from the client, L2F does not require any VPN client software. A L2F connection is intended to be made using L2F hardware. This hardware is designed to be at the ISP. A client would make a typical PPP connection to the ISP. The ISP then initiates the L2F tunnel connection on UDP port 1701 to the L2F server at the corporate headquarters. This requires coordination between the ISP and the corporate network. L2F relies on the PPP authentication to be passed on to the corporate authentication server.</p>

L2TP is considered to be an enhancement of the two previous protocols. It does not require specific hardware and can be initiated directly from the client. L2TP tunnel encapsulation is done on UDP port 1701. L2TP allows for tunnel authentication, so it does not have to rely heavily on the underlying PPP. If L2TP is used over an IP network where PPP is not used, the tunnel can be created with its own authentication mechanism.</p>

        <p class="noindent">All of the previously mentioned tunneling protocols lack one important security feature: encryption. Encryption can guarantee data confidentiality in a tunnel. IPsec offers encryption features that the other protocols lack. IPsec was designed to provide secure end-to-end connections. A VPN can take advantage of IPsec to provide network layer encryption as well as authentication techniques. IPsec is versatile in that it can be implemented easily in a remote access VPN (for remote file access) or a site-to-site VPN. For IPv6, IPsec is even more integral as it is embedded within the IPv6 packets.</p>
        <p class="noindent">IPsec uses two primary security protocols: Authentication Header (<a id="ch11key97" href="glossary.xhtml#glo29"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>AH</strong></span></a>) and Encapsulating Security Payload (<a id="ch11key98" href="glossary.xhtml#glo191"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ESP</strong></span></a>). AH guarantees the authenticity of the IP packets. It uses a one-way hash algorithm such as MD5 or SHA to ensure the data integrity of the IP packets. ESP provides confidentiality to the data messages (payloads) by way of encryption. It uses symmetrical encryption algorithms such as Data Encryption Standard (<a id="ch11key99" href="glossary.xhtml#glo144"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>DES</strong></span></a>), Triple Data Encryption Standard (<a href="glossary.xhtml#glo144"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>3DES</strong></span></a>), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

        <p class="noindent">Before an IPsec tunnel can be established, quite a few security parameters have to be negotiated and agreed upon by both ends. IPsec uses the Internet Key Exchange (<a id="ch11key100" href="glossary.xhtml#glo274"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>IKE</strong></span></a>) protocol to manage such processes. IKE is a hybrid protocol that encompasses several key management protocols, most notably Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (<a id="ch11key101" href="glossary.xhtml#glo306"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ISAKMP</strong></span></a>). Many times, the terms IKE and ISAKMP are mentioned alongside each other. There are two negotiation phases that the two network nodes must perform before the IPsec tunnel is complete. IKE Phase 1 is a phase in which the network nodes authenticate each other and set up an IKE SA (Security Association). In Phase 1, the <a id="ch11key102" href="glossary.xhtml#glo154"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Diffie-Hellman</strong></span></a> key exchange algorithm is used to generate a shared session secret key to encrypt the key exchange communications. This phase essentially sets up a secure channel to protect further negotiations in Phase 2. IKE Phase 2 uses the secure channel established in Phase 1 to negotiate the unidirectional IPsec SAs—inbound and outbound—to set up the IPsec tunnel. This is where the parameters for AH and ESP are negotiated.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section examines the setup of an end-to-end encrypted VPN connection using the Cisco VPN client software called Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client—or simply Cisco AnyConnect. Such connections can be used for both onsite and mobile (remote) users. The latest Cisco AnyConnect client is capable of using SSL/TLS or IPsec with IKEv2 as a transport protocol for the VPN connection.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_654"></span>The first step in setting up a Cisco VPN client is to install the software on the server that is to be used to establish the VPN connections. The VPN server in this case will most likely be a Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance), which has replaced the Cisco VPN concentrator platform. The Cisco AnyConnect client software must be licensed for each server installation and uploaded onto the server. The clients can then connect to the server and download the Cisco AnyConnect client software for installation. An individual requesting the software must have network access to the software. This usually requires that the user must have an authorized username and password. (The procedure to download the Cisco AnyConnect client software may differ depending on the organization.) After the software is installed, Cisco AnyConnect can be found in the Cisco folder under the Windows 10 All Apps menu.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section examines the important and often-overlooked task of providing physical security for a networking facility. The objective of physical security in this case is to protect personnel, data, hardware, and software from any physical actions that could cause any type of loss and/or damage.</p>
        <p class="noindent">There are three significant components of physical security:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key103" href="glossary.xhtml#glo10"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Access control</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> Physical security measures include access control cards, biometric access and access control systems, and lockable fencing.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key104" href="glossary.xhtml#glo599"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Surveillance</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> Surveillance often includes cameras monitoring the facility and the perimeter. Notification systems such as sensors for intrusion detection and even smoke detectors and heat sensors should also be included.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key105" href="glossary.xhtml#glo622"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Testing</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> An IT facility should have in place a good testing procedure for the physical security system. It is important to make sure the facility can quickly detect any intrusions and recover from any disruptions. Testing procedures should be conducted on a regular basis and updated as needed.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Access Control</p>

        <p class="box-title">Testing</p>
        <p class="box-para">A procedure for evaluating a physical security system</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_660"></span>The objective of this section is to make sure you have a clear understanding of how to establish and maintain good physical security. The technologies used to safeguard sensitive information in IT facilities are complex and expensive. Most facilities already have in place someone who is responsible for overseeing the physical protection plan.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In terms of physical security, the ideal situation is to have a security bubble surrounding a facility: It would involve providing physical protection with a 360-degree view of potential threats, keeping foot traffic to a minimum, and minimizing physical access. This type of bubble is not practical, however.</p>
        <p class="noindent">All IT facilities have some data that is transferred via wireless (Wi-Fi) connections. In fact, many sites within an IT facility are constantly being accessed by users locally and from the Internet, as well as by hackers. How can you make sure that their access is controlled? What measures or testing do you have in place to make sure you have a robust network? Integrating network security and enabling all software security features is recommended for any facility, and so is incorporating physical protection.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Physical security is designed to protect data, people, equipment, facility, and any critical company assets. You need to make sure that staff are willing to use the methods chosen for access control. A good access control system works only if users are willing to use it. So, it is very important to have a good employee training program to make sure every employee understands the rules.</p>
        <p class="noindent">All facilities have points for both ingress (going in) and egress (going out) foot traffic. Obviously, you will need some form of access control for these points. Controlled access to a facility begins at the doors (both front and back) and is for any person who has authority and whose job responsibilities require specific access to designated areas.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Security in any organization needs to incorporate multiple layers of access control. It can include any of the following <a id="ch11key106" href="glossary.xhtml#glo455"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>physical access control devices</strong></span></a>:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec49">Access Control Hardware</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The purpose of <a id="ch11key107" href="glossary.xhtml#glo11"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>access control hardware</strong></span></a> is to identify and authenticate someone entering a facility. It is similar to computer access control. Authentication factors can be based on the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Something you know:</strong> This could be a code, a password, or a PIN.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Something you have:</strong> This could be a key, a security card, or a token.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_661"></span><strong>Something you are:</strong> This could be a biometric factor, such as voice, fingerprint, retina, or iris recognition.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Access Control Hardware</p>
        <p class="box-para">Hardware used to identify and authenticate someone entering a facility</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A number of types of access control hardware are used in the industry to prevent unauthorized physical access. They are used to make sure that personnel or visitors have adequate permissions to access various facilities. Access can be controlled on site or remotely. The following are some examples of common access control hardware:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key108" href="glossary.xhtml#glo56"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Badge readers</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> An access badge typically includes a photograph and information that identifies the user. The user’s level of access is usually not encoded on the badge. When a user places a badge on or moves a badge close to the badge reader, the card reader reads the identifier information from the card and searches its access control database to determine whether the user is allowed access to the premises. Proximity cards are commonly used for badges.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Biometric scanners:</strong> Compared to badge readers, biometric scanners are more sophisticated and higher cost, but they are very effective. Biometric scanners authorize users based on who they are and so provide a very effective way of identifying users. It is very difficult to fake fingerprint, voice, and retina scans. Biometrics can be used in place of access badges or used with access badges for additional security.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key109" href="glossary.xhtml#glo13"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Access control vestibule</strong></span></a> <strong>(previously known as a</strong> <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo13"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>mantrap</strong></span></a><strong>):</strong> An access control vestibule is typically two interlocking doors in which the first set of doors must be closed before the second set of doors can open. This arrangement, which is sometimes called a sally port, an air lock, or a mantrap, is designed to limit the number of people who can access a particular area at one time. An additional security check can be enforced once a person is in an access control vestibule.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key111" href="glossary.xhtml#glo337"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Locking racks</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> Critical equipment for an IT facility is often mounted in racks, and rack security is a major concern. You need to know when racks are accessed and when equipment is changed or removed. Racks typically need to be locked as a part of building and access security.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key110" href="glossary.xhtml#glo336"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Locking cabinets</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> In the IT world, locking cabinets is another step in physical protection. Having critical equipment and documents locked up provides an additional layer of access control. A locked room helps minimize unauthorized access to IT equipment, and locked cabinets provide another layer of protection.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">After a person gains access to a facility, security surveillance should continue to be enforced. It is important to do real-time monitoring of people who are inside the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_662"></span>facility and keep track of their locations. The following are examples of some of the most widely used detection methods:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Surveillance cameras:</strong> Surveillance cameras have been in use for a long time—since the days of CCTV (closed-circuit television).

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec51">Asset Disposal</h4>
        <p class="noindent">An important part of physical access security focuses on what to do to with equipment when it reaches the end of its life cycle (EOL) or when it malfunctions. Equipment that contains configuration and proprietary information cannot just be thrown away. Rather, it must be handled according to the asset disposal policy of an organization. The following are common asset disposal practices:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key113" href="glossary.xhtml#glo532"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Sanitize devices</strong></span></a> <strong>for disposal:</strong> A tech-savvy person may be able to recover personal information from electronic devices (such as computers, hard drives, cell phones, networking equipment, and USB drives) that have been disposed of. It is therefore extremely important that all devices be sanitized before being thrown away. Sanitizing a device means wiping all information from the device.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><a id="ch11key114" href="glossary.xhtml#glo201"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Factory reset</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> A factory reset, also called a hard reset or a master reset, restores a device to the factory settings. Applications, data, pictures, are deleted. Such resets are often performed to restore malfunctioning devices. A factory reset typically requires administrative access.</p></li>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec52">Internet of Things (IoT) Security Devices</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A lot of technologies are available to aid with physical security. Probably the most interesting of them are the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are smart devices that connect to an organization’s network as well as the Internet. Their flexibility makes these devices easy to install and connect to a network, but it is imperative to ensure that external access (by hackers) can be prevented. The following are some examples of IoT devices that are commonly used for physical security in homes and offices:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>IP security cameras:</strong> These devices, which have become very popular in the recent years, are easy to install and connect to a network. Many companies offer cloud security camera services, so that cameras can connect to a cloud provider and send security footage to cloud storage. Users are able to view this footage from a computer or mobile device.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">This chapter presents a short overview of network security. A network administrator needs to not only design, assemble, and maintain a good network but also protect the network and its users from both external and internal (insider) threats. This chapter introduces some of the concepts that are critical to network security. You should understand the following concepts:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull">The various ways an attacker can gain control of a network</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">How denial-of-service attacks are initiated and how they can be prevented</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">How security software like antivirus/anti-malware and personal firewalls works and why this software is important for protecting a computer and a network</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">What sources are trusted sources and techniques used to identify trusted sources, grant access to trusted sources, and manage accessibility for trusted sources</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">How security appliances such as firewalls, IPSs, and web filters work and why they are important for protecting a network</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">How VPN technologies work and how to set up simple VPN clients</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">How to secure 802.11 wireless LANs and what security issues a network administrator must be aware of when configuring a wireless LAN</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">The importance of physical security in protecting data, people, equipment, facility, and other critical company assets</p></li>
