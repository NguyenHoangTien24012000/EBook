        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"></span>Recent advances in the development and manufacture of fiber-optic systems have made them the latest frontier in the field of optical networking. These systems are being used extensively for both private and commercial data links and have replaced a lot of copper wire. The latest networking technologies to benefit from the developments in optical networking are Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet.</p>
        <section>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch3lev1sec1"><span class="space">3-1</span> Introduction</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A fiber-optic network is surprisingly simple, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig01">Figure 3-1</a>. It is composed of the following elements:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">A fiber-optic transmission strand can carry the signal (in the form of a modulated light beam) a few feet or even hundreds or thousands of miles. A cable may contain three or four hair-like fibers or a bundle of hundreds of such fibers.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">A source of invisible infrared (IR) radiation—usually a light-emitting diode (LED) or a solid-state laser—light beam can be modulated by digital data or an analog signal.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">A photosensitive detector converts the optical signal back into an electrical signal at the receiver.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">Efficient optical connectors are at the light-source-to-cable interface and at the cable-to-photo detector interface. These connectors are critical when splicing the optical cable due to the fact that excessive loss can occur at connections.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The advantages of optical communication links compared to copper conductors are enormous and include the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Extremely wide system bandwidth:</strong> The intelligence is impressed on the light by varying the light’s amplitude. The best LEDs have a 5 ns response time and provide a maximum bandwidth of about 100MHz. With laser light sources, however, data rates over 10Gbps are possible with single-mode fiber. The amount of information multiplexed on such a system—in the hundreds of gigabits per second—is indeed staggering.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Immunity to electrostatic interference:</strong> External electrical noise and lightning do not affect energy in a fiber-optic strand. However, this is true only for the optical strands and not the metallic cable components or connecting electronics.</p>

        <aside class="hidden" id="Alch03fig01">
        <p>The Fiber-optic communication system comprises a transmitter and a receiver. The input signal is transmitted to a Modulator, light source is given to the Modulator. The Modulator transmits the signal to a 'Source-to-fiber connection,' this connection is labeled, "Transmitter." From the Source-to-fiber connection, an optical fiber is connected to a 'Fiber-to-detector connection,' then to a 'Light detector', this connection is labeled, "Receiver."</p>

        <li><p class="bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127"></span><strong>Elimination of crosstalk:</strong> The light in one glass fiber does not interfere with, nor is it susceptible to, the light in an adjacent fiber. Recall that crosstalk results from the electromagnetic coupling between two adjacent copper wires.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Lower signal attenuation than with other propagation systems:</strong> Typical attenuation of a 1GHz bandwidth signal for optical fibers is 0.03 dB per 100 feet, compared to 4.0 dB for RG-58U coaxial.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Lower costs:</strong> Optical fiber costs are continuing to decline, and the costs of many optical systems are decreasing as fiber is used more and more.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Safety:</strong> In many wired systems, the potential hazard of short circuits requires precautionary designs. In addition, the dielectric nature of fiber optics eliminates the spark hazard.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Corrosion:</strong> Given that glass is basically inert, the corrosive effects of certain environments are not a problem.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Security:</strong> Due to its immunity to electromagnetic coupling and radiation, optical fiber can be used in most secure environments. Although interception and tapping are possible, they are very difficult to do.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128"></span>This chapter examines optical networking. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec2">Section 3-2</a>, “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec2">The Nature of Light</a>,” presents an overview of optical fiber fundamentals, including a discussion on wavelengths and types of optical fibers. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec3">Section 3-3</a>, “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec3">Fiber Attenuation and Dispersion</a>,” examines the two distance-limiting parameters in fiber-optic transmission: attenuation and dispersion. Optical components are presented in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec4">Section 3-4</a>, “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec4">Optical Components</a>,” including the various types of connectors currently used on fiber. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec5">Section 3-5</a>, “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec5">Optical Networking</a>,” provides an overview of SONET and FDDI, as well as optical Ethernet. It also includes a discussion on setting up a building and campus distribution for fiber. Safety is extremely important when working with fiber. A brief overview of safety is presented in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec6">Section 3-6</a>, “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec6">Safety</a>.” <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec7">Section 3-7</a> “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec7">Troubleshooting Fiber Optics</a>” examines traces obtained from OTDR tests.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03tab01">Table 3-1</a> outlines the CompTIA Network+ objectives related to this chapter and identifies the chapter section that covers each objective.

        <p class="noindent">Before you can understand the propagation of light in a glass fiber, it is necessary to review some basics of light refraction and reflection. The speed of light in free space is 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second but is reduced in other media, including fiber-optic cables. The reduction as light passes into denser material results in refraction of the light. Refraction causes the light wave to be bent, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig02">Figure 3-2</a>(a). The speed reduction and subsequent refraction are different for each wavelength, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig02">Figure 3-2</a>(b). The visible light striking the prism in this figure causes refraction at both air/glass interfaces and separates the light into its various frequencies (colors), as shown. This same effect produces a rainbow, with water droplets acting as prisms to split the sunlight into the visible spectrum of colors (that is, the various frequencies).</p>
        <p class="noindent">The amount of bend provided by refraction depends on the <a id="ch3key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo498"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>refractive index</strong></span></a> of the two materials involved. The refractive index, <em>n</em>, is the ratio of the speed of light in free space to the speed in a given material. It is slightly variable for different frequencies of light, but for most purposes, a single value is accurate enough.</p>

A convenient point of commonality is that 3 × 10<sup>14</sup>Hz, or 300THz, is equivalent to 1 μm, or 1000 nm. This relationship is shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig03">Figure 3-3</a>. The one exception to this naming convention is when discussing dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), which is the transmission of several optical channels, or wavelengths, in the 1550 nm range, all on the same fiber. For DWDM systems, notations and channel separations are stated in terahertz (THz). Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems are discussed in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3lev1sec5">Section 3-5</a>.

These fibers support many waveguide modes and are called <a id="ch3key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo383"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>multimode fibers</strong></span></a>. The first commercial fiber-optic systems used multimode fibers with light at 800–900 nm wavelengths.

        <p class="noindent">As the technology became more mature, the single-mode fibers were found to provide lower losses and even higher bandwidth. This led to their use at 1300 nm, 1550 nm, and up to 1625 nm in many telecommunication and fiber-to-the home applications. The new developments have not made old types of fiber obsolete. The application now determines the type used. The following major criteria affect the choice of fiber type:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">Signal losses</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">Ease of light coupling and interconnection</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">Bandwidth</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig06">Figure 3-6</a> illustrates a fiber with three modes (that is, multimode) of propagation:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">The lowest-order mode is traveling along the axis of the fiber.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">The middle-order mode is reflected twice at the interface.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">The highest-order mode is reflected many times and makes many trips across the fiber.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">As a result of these variable path lengths, the light entering the fiber takes a variable length of time to reach the detector. This results in a pulse-broadening or dispersion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133"></span>characteristic, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig06">Figure 3-6</a>. This effect, termed <a id="ch3key7" href="glossary.xhtml#glo486"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>pulse dispersion</strong></span></a>, limits the maximum distance and rate at which data (pulses of light) can be practically transmitted. In addition, the output pulse has reduced amplitude as well as increased width. The greater the fiber length, the more pronounced this effect. As a result, manufacturers rate their fiber in bandwidth per length. For example, the rating 400MHz/km means the fiber can successfully transmit pulses at the rate of 400MHz for 1 kilometers, 200MHz for 2 kilometers, and so on. In fact, current networking standards limit multimode fiber distances to 2 kilometers. Longer transmission paths are attained by locating regenerators at appropriate locations. Step-index multimode fibers are rarely used in networking due to their very high amounts of pulse dispersion and minimal bandwidth capability.</p>

In the manufacturing process for this fiber, the index of refraction is tailored to follow the parabolic profile shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig07">Figure 3-7</a>. This results in low-order modes traveling through the constant-density material in the center. High-order modes see a lower index of refraction material farther from the core, and thus the velocity of propagation increases away from the center. Therefore, all modes, even though they take various paths and travel different distances, tend to traverse the fiber length in about the same amount of time. These fibers can therefore handle higher bandwidths and/or provide longer transmission distances before pulse dispersion effects destroy intelligibility and introduce bit errors.</p>

Fibers are specified by the diameters of their core and cladding. For example, the fibers just described would be called 50/125 fiber and 62.5/125 fiber.</p>

        <p class="noindent">There are two key distance-limiting parameters in fiber-optic transmissions: attenuation and dispersion.</p>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch3lev2sec5">Attenuation</h4>
        <p class="noindent"><em>Attenuation</em> is the loss of power introduced by fiber. This loss accumulates as the light is propagated through the fiber strand. The loss is expressed in dB/km (decibels per kilometer) of length. The attenuation, or loss, of the signal is due to the combination of four factors: scattering, absorption, macrobending, and microbending. There are also two types of attenuation: intrinsic and extrinsic.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch3key12" href="glossary.xhtml#glo535"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Scattering</strong></span></a> is the primary loss factor over the three wavelength ranges. Scattering in telecommunication systems accounts for 96% of the loss and is the basis of the attenuation curves and values, such as that shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig09">Figure 3-9</a>, and industry data sheets. Scattering known as Rayleigh scattering is caused by refractive index fluctuations. Rayleigh scattering decreases as wavelength increases, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig09">Figure 3-9</a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The second loss factor, <a id="ch3key13" href="glossary.xhtml#glo9"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>absorption</strong></span></a>, is a composite of light interaction with the atomic structure of the glass. It involves the conversion of optical power to heat. One portion of the absorption loss is due to the presence of OH hydroxoyl ions dissolved in the glass during manufacture. They cause the water attenuation or OH peaks, shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig09">Figure 3-9</a>, and other attenuation curves.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><a id="ch3key14" href="glossary.xhtml#glo345"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Macrobending</strong></span></a> is loss caused by the light mode breaking up and escaping into the cladding when the fiber bend becomes too tight. As the wavelength increases, the loss in a bend increases. Although losses are in fractions of a dB, the bend radius in small splicing trays and patching enclosures should be minimal.</p>

For example, excessively tight tie wraps or clamps contribute to this loss. This loss is noted in fractions of a decibel.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"></span>Modal dispersion occurs predominantly in multimode fiber. From a light source, the light rays can take many paths as they propagate along the fiber. Some light rays travel in a straight line, but most take variable-length routes. As a result, the rays arrive at the detector at different times, and the result is pulse broadening (refer to <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig06">Figures 3-6</a> and <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig04">3-7</a>). The use of graded-index fiber greatly reduces the effects of modal dispersion and therefore increases the bandwidth to about 1GHz/km. On the other hand, single-mode fiber does not exhibit modal dispersion, given that only a single mode is transmitted.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A second, equally important, type of dispersion is chromatic. Chromatic dispersion is present in both single-mode and multimode fibers. Basically, the light source (whether laser or LED) produces several different wavelength light rays when generating the light pulse. The light rays travel at different velocities, and as a result, these rays arrive at the receiver detector at different times, causing the broadening of the pulse.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Zero-Dispersion Wavelength</p>
        <p class="box-para">The point at which dispersion is zero</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">There is a point at which dispersion is actually at zero, and it is determined by the refractive index profile. It happens near 1310 nm and is called the <a id="ch3key17" href="glossary.xhtml#glo698"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>zero-dispersion wavelength</strong></span></a>. By altering the refractive index profile, this zero-dispersion wavelength can be shifted to the 1550 nm region. Such fibers are called <em>dispersion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139"></span>shifted</em>. This is significant because the 1550 nm region exhibits a lower attenuation than occurs at 1310 nm. This becomes an operational advantage, particularly to long-haul carriers, because with minimum attenuation and minimum dispersion in the same wavelength region, repeater and regenerator spacing can be maximized.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Polarization mode is the type of dispersion found in single-mode systems, and it becomes a particular concern in long-haul and WAN high-data-rate digital and high-bandwidth analog video systems. In a single-mode fiber, the single propagating mode has two polarizations, horizontal and vertical, or <em>X</em> axis and <em>Y</em> axis. The index of refraction can be different for the two components; this affects their relative velocity, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig11">Figure 3-11</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch3lev2sec7">Dispersion Compensation</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A considerable amount of fiber in use today was installed in the 1980s and early 1990s. This cable was called the Class IVa variety. These cables were optimized to operate in the 1310 nm region, which means their zero-dispersion point was in the 1310 nm wavelength. Due to continuous network expansion needs in recent years, it is often desired to add transmission capacity to the older fiber cables by using the 1550 nm region, particularly because the attenuation at 1550 nm is less than at 1310 nm. One major problem arises at this point: The dispersion value is higher at 1550 nm, which severely limits its distance capability.</p>

This fiber acts as an equalizer, with negative dispersion canceling positive dispersion. The fiber consists of a small coil normally placed in the equipment rack just prior to the optical receiver input. This introduces some insertion loss (3–10 dB) and may require the addition of an optical-line amplifier.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">The diode laser is a preferred source for moderate-band to wideband systems. It offers a fast response time (typically less than 1 ns) and can couple high levels of useful optical power (usually several mW) into an optical fiber with a small core and a small numerical aperture. The DL is usually used as the source for single-mode fiber because LEDs have a low input coupling efficiency.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Some systems operate at a slower bit rate and require more modest levels of fiber-coupled optical power (50–250 μW). These applications allow the use of high-radiance LEDs. The LED is cheaper, requires less complex driving circuitry than a DL, and needs no thermal or optical stabilizations.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The light output wavelength spread, or spectrum, of DLs is much narrower than that of LEDs: about 1 nm compared with about 40 nm for an LED. Narrow spectra are advantageous in systems with high bit rates since the dispersion effects of the fiber on pulse width are reduced, and thus pulse degradation over long distances is minimized.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another laser device, called a <a id="ch3key22" href="glossary.xhtml#glo160"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>distributed feedback (DFB) laser</strong></span></a>, uses techniques that provide optical feedback in the laser cavity. This enhances output stability, which produces a narrow and more stable spectral width, in the range 0.01–0.1 nm. This allows the use of more channels in <a id="ch3key23" href="glossary.xhtml#glo143"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM)</strong></span></a> systems. Another even more recent development is an entirely new class of laser semiconductors called <a id="ch3key24" href="glossary.xhtml#glo663"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs)</strong></span></a>. These lasers can support a much faster signal rate than LEDs, including Gigabit networks. They do not face some of the operational and stability problems that plague conventional lasers, however.</p>

The primary market for these devices is network operations environments that involve DWDM. Traffic routing is often made by wavelength, and, as such, wavelengths or transmitters must be assigned and reassigned to accommodate dynamic routing or networking, bandwidth on demand, seamless restoration (serviceability), optical packet switching, and so on. Tunable lasers are used along with either passive or tunable WDM filters.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch3lev2sec11">Detectors</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The devices used to convert the transmitted light back into an electrical signal are a vital link in a fiber-optic system. This important link is often overlooked in favor of the light source and fibers. However, simply changing from one photodetector to another can increase the capacity of a system by an order of magnitude.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The important characteristics of light detectors are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Responsivity:</strong> This is a measure of output current for a given light power launched into the diode.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Response speed:</strong> This determines the maximum data rate capability of the detector.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Spectral response:</strong> This determines the responsivity that is achieved relative to the wavelength at which responsivity is specified.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">Fiber termination kits provide many common tools for terminating and joining optical fibers. They are typically joined either in a permanent fusion splice or with a mechanical splice (for example, connectors and camsplices). The connector allows repeated matings and unmatings. Above all, these connections must lose as little light as possible. Low loss depends on correct alignment of the core of one fiber to another or to a source or detector. Losses for properly terminated fusion and mechanical splices are typically 0.2 dB or less. Signal loss in fibers occurs when two fibers are not perfectly aligned within a connector. Axial misalignment typically causes the greatest loss—about 0.5 dB for a 10% displacement. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a> illustrates this condition as well as other loss sources.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Angular misalignment, illustrated in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a>(b), can usually be well controlled in a connector. Most connectors leave an air gap, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a>(c). The amount of gap affects loss because light leaving the transmitting fiber spreads conically.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The losses due to rough end surfaces shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a>(d) are often caused by a poor cut, or “cleave,” but can be minimized with polishing or by using prepolished connectors. Polishing typically takes place after a fiber has been placed in a connector. The source of connection losses shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a>(d) can, for the most part, be controlled by a skillful cable splicer. Four other situations can cause additional connector or splice loss, although in smaller values, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a>(e), (f), (g), and (h). These situations are related to the nature of the fiber strand at the point of connection and are beyond the control of the cable splicer. The effect of these losses can be minimized somewhat through the use of a rotary mechanical splice, which by the joint rotation will get a better core alignment.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144"></span>With regard to connectorization and splicing, there are two techniques to consider for splicing. <a id="ch3key29" href="glossary.xhtml#glo228"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Fusion splicing</strong></span></a> is a long-term method in which two fibers are fused or welded together. The two ends are stripped of their coating, cut or cleaved, and inserted into the splicer. The ends of the fiber are aligned, and an electric arc is fired across the ends, melting the glass and fusing the two ends together. There are both manual and automatic fusion splicers; the choice usually depends on the number of splices to be done on a given job, technician skill levels available, and, of course, budget. Typical insertion losses of less than 0.1 dB—frequently in the 0.05 dB range—can be consistently achieved.</p>

Mechanical splices join two fibers together, but they differ from fusion splices in that an air gap exists between the two fibers. This results in a glass–air–glass interface, causing a severe double change in the index of refraction. This change results in an increase in insertion loss and reflected power. The condition can be minimized by applying an <a id="ch3key31" href="glossary.xhtml#glo279"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>index-matching gel</strong></span></a> to the joint. The gel is a jellylike substance that has an index of refraction much closer to that of glass than to that of air. Therefore, the index change is much less severe. Mechanical splices have been universally popular for repair and for temporary or laboratory work. They are quick, cheap, easy, and appropriate for small jobs.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Considering that the core diameter of a single-mode fiber is only 9 μm, it is easy to understand that dirty optical cables can easily degrade data performance. Problems can result from a dirty fiber cable endface or loose contamination preventing good physical glass-to-glass contact.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145"></span>The best method for splicing depends on the application, including the expected future bandwidth (for example, Gigabit), traffic, the job size, and economics. The loss in a mechanical splice can be minimized by using an optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR) to properly align the fiber while making the splice.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Some general features of fiber connectors are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet">They are easy and quick to install.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">They offer low insertion loss. A properly installed connector has as little as 0.25 dB insertion loss.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">They provide a high return loss (greater than 50 dB). This is increasingly important in Gigabit networks, DWDM systems, high-bandwidth video, and so on.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">They offer repeatability.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet">They are economical.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146"></span>In preparing fiber for splicing or connectorization, only the coating is removed from the fiber strand. The core and the cladding are not separable. The 125 μm cladding diameter is the portion that fits into the splice or connector, and therefore most devices can handle both single-mode and multimode fiber.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Is it not advisable to splice together fibers of different core sizes. The one absolute rule is do <em>not</em> splice single- and multimode fiber together! Similarly, good professional work does not allow different sizes of multimode fiber to be spliced together. However, in an emergency, different sizes can be spliced together if the following is considered: When transmitting from a small- to large-core diameter, there will be minimal, if any, increase in insertion loss. However, when the transmission is from a larger to a smaller core size, there will be added insertion loss, and a considerable increase in reflected power should be expected.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Industrial practice has confirmed the acceptability of different core size interchangeability for emergency repairs in the field, mainly as a result of tests with 50 μm and 62.5 μm multimode fiber for a local area network.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Two additional concepts associated with fiber are APC and UPC. The difference between these two types of connectors is the fiber endface. An angled physical contact (APC) endface is polished and has an 8-degree angle. An ultra-physical contact (UPC) endface is polished and has no angle. APC and UPC connectors are easily identified by their color: APC adapters are green, and UPC adapters are blue.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Sometimes it may be necessary to verify that light is passing through an unconnected fiber. To do so, the fiber must not be connected to anything at either end. A light meter is sometimes used for this purpose. The function of a light meter is to shine light down a fiber, providing a safe way to visually verify that light is propagating down a fiber.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The need for increased bandwidth is pushing the fiber-optic community into optical networking solutions that are almost beyond the imagination of even the most <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148"></span>advanced networking person. Optical solutions for long-haul, wide area, metropolitan, campus, and local area networks are available. Cable companies are already using the high-bandwidth capability of fiber to distribute cable programming as well as data throughout their service areas.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The capital cost differences between a fiber system and a copper-based system are diminishing, and the choice of networking technology for new networks is no longer just budgetary. Fiber has the capacity to carry more bandwidth, and as the cost of fiber infrastructure decreases, fiber is more and more being chosen to carry data. Of course, the copper infrastructure is already in place, and new developments are providing increases in data speed over copper (for example, CAT6, CAT6a, CAT7, and CAT8). However, optical fiber is smaller and easier to install in already crowded ducts and conduits. In addition, security is enhanced because it is difficult to tap optical fiber without detection. Will fiber replace copper in computer networks? For many years, a hybrid solution of fiber and copper is expected.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch3lev2sec15">Defining Optical Networking</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Optical networks are becoming a major part of data delivery in homes, in businesses, and for long-haul carriers. The telecommunications industry has been using fiber to carry long-haul traffic for many years in order to provide high-bandwidth capabilities to the home. Developments in optical technologies are reshaping the way we will use fiber in future optical networks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">But there is a new slant with optical networks. DWDM and tunable lasers have changed the way optical networks can be implemented. It is now possible to transport many wavelengths over a single fiber. Lab tests at AT&amp;T have successfully demonstrated the transmission of 1022 wavelengths over a single fiber. This transport of multiple wavelengths opens up possibilities for routing or switching many different data protocols over the same fiber but on different wavelengths. The development of cross-connects that allow data to arrive on one wavelength and leave on another opens other possibilities.</p>

FTTC, which is being deployed today, provides high bandwidth to a location with proximity to the home and provides a high-speed data link, via copper (twisted-pair), using VDSL (very high-speed digital subscriber line). This is a cost-effective way to provide large bandwidth capabilities to a home. Currently, the Google Fiber project is at the forefront of FTTH. It has deployed FTTH in several cities, including Kansas City, Austin, Provo, Salt Lake City, Charlotte, Atlanta, Durham, and Nashville.</p>

In a star network, the computer and the switch are directly connected. If fiber is used in a star network, an internal or external media converter is required. The media converter converts the electronic signal to an optical signal and vice versa. A media converter is required at each end, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig15">Figure 3-15</a>.

Fiber lines consist of a minimum of two fibers: one for transmitting and one for receiving. Fiber networks work in full-duplex mode, which means the links must be able to simultaneously transmit and receive—hence the need for two fibers on each link. This is also referred to as <em>duplex operation</em>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Item A is the main fiber feed for the building. This is called a <em>building distribution</em> (<em>BD</em>) fiber. The two fibers for the BD link terminate into a main fiber cross-connect (item B). A <a id="ch3key40" href="glossary.xhtml#glo209"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>fiber cross-connect</strong></span></a> is an optical patch panel used to connect fiber cables to the next link at the fiber distribution panel. A fiber cross-connect typically uses mechanical splices to make the fiber connections.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A general rule for fiber is that the distribution in a building should be limited to “two deep.” This means that a building should have only the main distribution and the intermediate distribution that feeds the horizontal distribution to the work area.

The <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo696"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>XFP</strong></span></a>, shown in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154"></span><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig19">Figure 3-19</a>(e), has lower power consumption than the XENPAK, XPAK, and X2, but it still can deliver up to 80 kilometers in distance, which is the same as the older modules. With its small size, its lower power consumption, and its reachability, the XFP was thought to be the future of the 10 Gigabit transceiver. Recently, a new type of 10G transceiver has emerged, however: the <a href="glossary.xhtml#glo696"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>SFP+</strong></span></a>. Its looks just like a 1000BASE SFP transceiver and is the same size. To be able to deliver 10 Gigabit speed in its small form factor, the working distance that the SFP+ can deliver is reduced to 40 kilometers. So, if distance is not of concern, SFP+ might be the 10 Gigabit transceiver of choice. These modules support 850, 1310, and 1550 fiber wavelengths. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig19">Figure 3-19</a> shows examples of all these 1000BASE and 10GBASE transceivers. A quad small form-factor plus (QSFP+) is a new compact, hot-pluggable transceiver that has four SFP+ interfaces—that is 4 channels of 10Gbps date rate, so it can transfer up to 40Gbps.</p>

        <p class="noindent">In regard to characteristics of fiber transceivers, an optical transceiver chip is an integrated circuit (IC) that transmits and receives data using optical fiber rather than electrical wire. Almost all modern optical transceivers provide bidirectional data transmission by using two fibers to transmit data between switches, firewalls, servers, routers, and so on. The first fiber is dedicated to receiving data from networking equipment, and the second fiber is dedicated to transmitting data to the networking equipment.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A new optical transceiver technology is now available that allows transceivers to both transmit and receive data to/from interconnected equipment through a single optical fiber. This technology first emerged in 2012 and has led to the development of bidirectional (BiDi) transceivers. The primary difference between BiDi transceivers and traditional two-fiber fiber-optic transceivers is that BiDi transceivers are fitted with WDM couplers, also known as <em>diplexers</em>, which combine and separate data transmitted over a single fiber based on the wavelengths of the light. For this reason, BiDi transceivers are also referred to as WDM transceivers.</p>

These two telco connections provide for redundant Internet and WAN data services. If something happens in building 1 that shuts down the external data services, Internet and WAN data traffic can be switched to building 2. Also, data traffic can be distributed over both connections to prevent bottlenecking. Buildings 1 and 2 are interconnected with 36 multimode (<a id="ch3key48" href="glossary.xhtml#glo362"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>mm</strong></span></a>) and 48 single-mode (<a id="ch3key49" href="glossary.xhtml#glo560"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>sm</strong></span></a>) fibers. This is documented on the line interconnecting buildings 1 and 2 (item C) and written as 36/48 (item D). The dotted line between buildings 1 and 2 indicates the <a id="ch3key50" href="glossary.xhtml#glo53"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>backbone</strong></span></a>, or main fiber distribution for the campus network.

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157"></span>In the <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig20">Figure 3-20</a> example, the newer fiber cabling installations were run with a 36/48 and 24/48 mix. Why the difference? The main reason is economics. The cost per foot (meter) of the new fiber is lower, so more fiber can be placed in a cable for the same cost per foot.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The fiber connecting the buildings is typically run either in PVC conduit, which makes it easy to add or remove fiber cables, or in trenches or tunnels. Running fiber in trenches is very expensive and significantly increases the installation cost. (Note that network administrators need to be aware of any trenches being dug on campus.) Even if the budget doesn’t allow for buying fiber at the time, it is important to at least have a conduit and pull line installed.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Fiber provides substantially increased bandwidth for building and campus networks and can easily handle the combined traffic of PCs, switches, routers, video, and voice services. Fiber has great capacity, enabling fast transfer of data, minimizing congestion problems, and providing tremendous growth potential for each of the fiber runs.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another important application of optical Ethernet is extending the reach of the Ethernet network from the local and campus network out to the metropolitan and wide area networks. Essentially, optical networking is introducing Ethernet as a viable WAN technology. Extending Ethernet into a WAN is a seamless integration of the technologies. The Ethernet extension into the WAN simply requires optical adapters such as a GBIC and two fiber strands: one for transmitting and one for receiving. Conventional high-speed Ethernet LANs operating over fiber use the numerics listed in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03tab03">Table 3-3</a>, earlier in this chapter, to describe the network configuration.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Now that you have learned how to design optical networks and interconnect the optical links, you need to know how to ensure that the signals will arrive at the destination with the desired received signal level (RSL). This section demonstrates the steps required for calculating an <a id="ch3key51" href="glossary.xhtml#glo426"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>optical link budget</strong></span></a>. Basically, an optical link budget begins with the transmitter output power and then subtracts the losses. Losses can be from fiber splices or from patch panels, pig-tails, or multiplexers.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">You need to use the manufacturer specifications to determine the transmit power and subtract losses due to cable losses, splice losses, connector losses, and extra losses from any mechanical or WDM devices. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig22">Figure 3-22</a> provides an example of a link budget calculation.</p>

        <aside class="hidden" id="Alch03fig22">
        <p>In the example, the optical link budget calculation is given as follows: a positive result of transceiver output power, negative result of cable losses, negative result of splice losses, negative result of connector losses, and negative result of extra losses results in total link budget.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158"></span>A positive result for the total link budget indicates that the proper signal level will be received at the receiver. A negative result indicates that the signal level is not sufficient to properly drive the receiver.</p>
        <p class="noindent">To practice calculating a link budget, try this example. Provide a link budget calculation given the following:</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">Transceiver output power of –15 dBm</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">6 splices at 0.1 dB each</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">2 connectors at 0.3 dB each</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">Total link budget = –15 dBm – (6 × 0.1) – (2 × 0.3)</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">= –15 dBm – 0.6 dB – 0.6 dB = –16.2 dBm</p>
        <p class="noindent">Next, compare the total link budget to the desired RSL, which is the minimum signal level required to meet the desired bit error rate (BER) for the receiver. In this case, the desired RSL is –18 dBm; therefore, the system has 1.8 dB of extra margin.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Several techniques can be used to measure and troubleshoot fiber links. A common technique is to use an optical power meter to determine power loss. Another tool used is a <a id="ch3key52" href="glossary.xhtml#glo666"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>visual fault locator (VFL)</strong></span></a>, which shines light down the fiber to help locate broken glass. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig23">Figure 3-23</a> shows traces obtained from an <a id="ch3key53" href="glossary.xhtml#glo428"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR)</strong></span></a> for two different sets of multimode fibers; this is called <em>shooting</em> the fiber. The OTDR sends a light pulse down the fiber and measures the reflected light. The OTDR enables an installer or a maintenance crew to verify the quality of each fiber span and obtain some measure of performance. The <em>X</em> axis on the traces indicates the distance, and the <em>Y</em> axis indicates the measured optical power value in decibels. Both OTDR traces are for 850 nm multimode fiber.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Visual Fault Locator (VFL)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A device that shines light down fiber to help locate broken glass</p>

        <p class="box-para">A device that sends a light pulse down fiber and measures the reflected light, providing a measure of performance for the fiber</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig23">Figure 3-23</a>(a), point A is a “dead” zone, or a point too close to the OTDR for a measurement to be made. The measured value begins at about 25 dB and decreases as the distance traveled increases. An <a id="ch3key54" href="glossary.xhtml#glo196"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>event</strong></span></a>, or a disturbance in the light propagating down the fiber, occurs at point B. This is an example of what a poor-quality splice looks like (in regard to reflection as well as insertion loss). It is most likely a mechanical splice. The same type of event occurs at points C and D, which are also most likely mechanical splices. Points F and G are most likely the jumpers and patch panel connections at the fiber end. The steep drop at point H is actually the end of the fiber. Point I is typical noise that occurs at the end of an unterminated fiber. Notice at point G that the overall value of the trace has dropped to about 17 dB. There has been about 8 dB of optical power loss in the cable in a 1.7 kilometer run.</p>

        <p class="box-para">A disturbance in the light propagating down a fiber span that results in a disturbance on the OTDR trace</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">An OTDR trace for another multimode fiber is shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig23">Figure 3-23</a>(b); the hump at point A is basically a dead zone. An OTDR cannot typically return accurate measurement values in this region. This is common for most OTDRs, and the dead zone varies for each OTDR. The useful trace information begins at point B, with a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163"></span>measured value of 20 dB. Point C shows a different type of event, which is typical of coiled fiber or fiber that has been tightly bound, possibly with a tie-wrap, or that has had some other disturbance affecting the integrity of the fiber. Points D and F are actually the end of the fiber. At point D, the trace level is about 19 dB, for a loss of about 1 dB over the 150 meter run. Point G is just the noise that occurs at the end of a terminated fiber.</p>
