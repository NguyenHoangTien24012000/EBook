        <h3 class="h3" id="ch1lev1sec1"><span class="space">1-1</span> Introduction</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Each day, computer users use their computers for browsing the Internet, sending and retrieving email, scheduling meetings, sharing files, preparing reports, exchanging images, downloading music, and checking the current prices of auction items. A network connects computers with the goal of sharing their resources. The networks around the world that are connected together form the Internet. Networking requires that computers be able to access multiple networks and share their resources. This chapter looks at the various types of computer networks that are in use today.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This book introduces the essentials involved in implementing modern computer networks, stepping you through the various modern networking technologies. The accompanying textbook web link takes you to the Net-Challenge simulator software developed specifically for this text. This software gives you invaluable insight into the inner workings of computer networking and the experience of configuring routers and switches for use in computer networks.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The ease of connecting to the Internet and the dramatic decrease in the cost of computer systems have led to an explosion in the use of computer systems. Organizations such as corporations, colleges, and government agencies have acquired large numbers of single-user computer systems. Such systems might be dedicated to word processing, scientific computation, or process control, or they might be general-purpose computers that perform many tasks. Interconnection of locally distributed computer networks enables users to exchange information (data) with other network members. It also makes possible resource sharing, enabling many to access expensive equipment such as file servers and high-quality graphics printers as well as more powerful computers for tasks too complicated for the local computer to process.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The networks in use today can be generally categorized based on their geographic span:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Personal area network (PAN):</strong> A PAN is the smallest type of network and has a limited span, interconnecting personal devices such as those that are Bluetooth enabled.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"></span><a id="ch1key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo335"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Local area network (LAN)</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> A LAN is a network commonly used to interconnect and share computer resources inside a building or multiple buildings in a limited area.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Local Area Network (LAN)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A network of users that share computer resources in a limited area</p>
        </div></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Campus area network (CAN):</strong> A CAN—often called simple an <em>enterprise network</em>—spans multiple buildings in a campus environment such as a university or another large organization.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Metropolitan area network (MAN):</strong> A MAN spans multiple buildings in a city area.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Wide area network (WAN):</strong> A WAN is much larger than the other network types and can span many areas, such as cities, states, or countries.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab01">Table 1-1</a> outlines the CompTIA Network+ objectives related to this chapter and identifies the chapter section that covers each objective. At the end of each chapter section you will find a review with comments on the Network+ objectives presented in that section. These comments are provided to help reinforce your understanding of each Network+ objective. The chapter review also includes “Test Your Knowledge” questions to help you understand key concepts before you advance to the next section of the chapter. At the end of the chapter you will find a complete set of questions as well as sample certification exam-type questions.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The simplest network topology is a point-to-point architecture, where two computers are connected directly together. In this topology, communication flows only between the two computers. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig02">Figure 1-2</a> shows an example of a LAN configured using the ring topology. This topology is predominantly used by <a id="ch1key4" href="glossary.xhtml#glo630"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Token Ring networks</strong></span></a>, in which a token (indicated with the letter T in the network diagram) is placed in the data channel and circulates around the ring (hence the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"></span>name <em>Token Ring</em>)<em>.</em> If a user wants to transmit, the computer waits until it has control of the token. This technique, called <a id="ch1key5" href="glossary.xhtml#glo628"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>token passing</strong></span></a>, is based on the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring Network standard. (<a id="ch1key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo270"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>IEEE</strong></span></a> is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.) A Token Ring network is a <a id="ch1key7" href="glossary.xhtml#glo146"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>deterministic</strong></span></a> network, which means each station connected to the network is ensured access for transmission of its messages at regular or fixed time intervals.</p>

        <p class="noindent">One disadvantage of the Token Ring topology is that if an error changes the token pattern, the token may stop circulating. In addition, ring networks rely on each system to relay the data to the next user. A failed station can cause data traffic to cease. Token Ring networks also have disadvantages in terms of troubleshooting and maintenance. In order to remove a device from a Token Ring network or add a device to the network, the Token Ring path must be temporarily broken (that is, the path must be interrupted). This results in downtime for the network. One way to fix this issue is by attaching all the computers to a central <a id="ch1key8" href="glossary.xhtml#glo629"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Token Ring hub</strong></span></a>, which is a device that manages the passing of the token rather than relying on individual computers to pass it, thereby improving the reliability of the network.</p>

        <p class="noindent">In a bus topology, all LAN data traffic is carried over a common coaxial cable link. In <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig03">Figure 1-3</a>, for example, if computer 1 is printing a large file, the line of communications is between computer 1 and the printer. However, in a bus system, all networking devices can see computer 1’s data traffic to the printer, and the other devices have to wait for pauses in transmission or until transmission is complete before they can initiate their own transmissions. If more than one computer’s data is placed on the network at the same time, the data is corrupted and has to be retransmitted. This means that the use of a shared coaxial cable in a bus topology prevents data transmission from being very bandwidth efficient. This is one reason—but not the only reason—bus topologies are seldom used in modern computer networks.</p>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"></span>
        <p class="noindent">The <a id="ch1key10" href="glossary.xhtml#glo583"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>star topology</strong></span></a> (also called hub-and-spoke topology), illustrated in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a>, is the most common networking topology in today’s LANs. Twisted-pair cables with modular plugs are used to connect the computers and other networking devices (see <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a>, “<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2">Physical Layer Cabling: Twisted-Pair</a>”). At the center of a star network is either a switch or a hub that connects the network devices and facilitates the transfer of data. For example, if computer 1 in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a> wants to send data to the network laser printer, the hub or switch provides the network connection. If a hub is used, computer 1’s data is sent to the <a id="ch1key11" href="glossary.xhtml#glo260"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>hub</strong></span></a>, which then forwards it to the printer. However, a hub is a <a id="ch1key12" href="glossary.xhtml#glo386"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>multiport repeater</strong></span></a>, which means the data it receives is <a id="ch1key13" href="glossary.xhtml#glo70"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>broadcast</strong></span></a> and seen by all devices connected to its ports. Therefore, the hub broadcasts computer 1’s data traffic to all networking devices that are interconnected in the star network. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a> shows this data traffic path as solid black arrowed lines going to all networking devices. Much as with the bus topology, all data traffic on the LAN is being seen by all computers. Because a hub broadcasts all data traffic to the devices connected to its network ports, this device is of limited use in a large network.</p>

        <p class="noindent">To minimize unnecessary data traffic and isolate sections of a network, you can use a <a id="ch1key14" href="glossary.xhtml#glo600"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>switch</strong></span></a> at the center of a star network, as shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a>. Each networking device, such as a computer, has a hardware or physical address. (This concept is fully detailed in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec4">Section 1-4</a>, “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec4">The Ethernet LAN</a>.”) A switch stores the hardware or physical address for each device connected to its ports. The storage of the address enables the switch to directly connect two communicating devices without broadcasting the data to all devices connected to its <a id="ch1key15" href="glossary.xhtml#glo465"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ports</strong></span></a>.</p>

        </div>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"></span>
        <p class="noindent">For example, if a switch is used instead of a hub, the data from computer 1 is transmitted directly to the printer, and the other computers do not see the data traffic. The dotted lines in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a> indicate the traffic path for a switched network. The use of a switched connection greatly improves the efficiency of the available bandwidth. It also permits additional devices in the LAN to simultaneously communicate with each other without tying up network resources. For example, while computer 1 is printing a large file, computers 5 and 6 can communicate with each other, as illustrated by the dashed line in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a>. During troubleshooting and maintenance, individual computers can be removed without negatively affecting the network in a star or extended star topology. Also, the upgrade from a hub to a switched topology can be accomplished without requiring a change in the cable infrastructure and therefore requires minimal downtime and expense.</p>

        <p class="noindent">In a <a id="ch1key16" href="glossary.xhtml#glo354"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>mesh topology</strong></span></a>, as illustrated in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig05">Figure 1-5</a>, all networking devices are directly connected to each other. This provides for full redundancy in the network data paths—but at a cost. The additional data paths increase the costs related to cabling and networking hardware (for example, multiple network ports for each device connected to the network). In addition, the mesh design adds complexity. This topology can be suitable for high-reliability applications but can be too costly for general networking applications.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The Open Systems Interconnection (<a id="ch1key17" href="glossary.xhtml#glo432"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>OSI</strong></span></a>) reference model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization in 1984 as an open standard for all communication systems to enable different types of networks to be linked together. As illustrated in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig06">Figure 1-6</a>, the OSI model contains seven layers that describe networking functions from the physical network interface to the software application interfaces. Different protocols operate at each layer. Each layer performs data encapsulation by putting its own message format or header onto the data as it is being passed down from layer 7 to layer 1 for transmission. When the data is received by an end device, the inverse process, called decapsulation, occurs. Each corresponding layer reads its layer message format or header and takes it off before passing the data to the upper layers.

        <p class="note-para">Network administrators often refer to layer numbers when describing networking problems. For example, a physical link problem is described as a layer 1 problem, and a router problem is a layer 3 issue.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">A network administrator needs to have a good understanding of all seven layers of the OSI model in order to be able to isolate network problems. There are three basic steps in the process of isolating a network problem:</p>
        <ol class="number-b">
        <li><p class="num">Is the connection to the machine down? (This is a layer 1 issue.)</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Is the network down? (This is a layer 3 issue.)</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Is a service on a specific machine down? (This is a layer 7 issue.)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noindent">A network administrator uses the OSI model to troubleshoot network problems by verifying the functionality of each layer. In many cases, troubleshooting network problems requires the network administrator to isolate at which layer a network problem occurs.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For example, say that a network is having problems accessing an email server that uses SMTP—a layer 7 application. The first troubleshooting step for the network administrator is to ping the IP address of the email server (layer 3 test). A ping to an IP address can be used to quickly check whether there is a network connection. (The <strong>ping</strong> command is discussed in detail in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec7">Section 1-7</a>, “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1lev1sec7">Testing and Troubleshooting a LAN</a>.”) A “reply from” response for the ping indicates that the connection to the server is up. A “request timed out” response indicates that the network connection is down. This could be due to a cabling problem (layer 1) or a problem with a switch (layer 2) or a router (layer 3), or the email server could be completely down (layer 7). In the event of a “request timed out” response, the network administrator has to go directly to the telecommunications closet or the machine to troubleshoot the problem. In this case, the administrator should first check for layer 1 (physical layer) problems. Many times this just requires verifying that a network cable is connected. Cables sometimes get knocked loose or break.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The networking protocol used in most modern computer networks is Ethernet, a carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (<strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key26" href="glossary.xhtml#glo131">CSMA/CD</a></span></strong>) protocol for local area networks. It originated in 1972, and the full specification for the protocol was provided in 1980, as a joint effort of Xerox, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Intel. Basically, for a computer to “talk” on an Ethernet network, it first “listens” to see whether there is any data traffic (<em>carrier-sense</em>). This means that any computer connected to the LAN can be “listening” for data traffic, and any of the computers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"></span>on the LAN can access the network (<em>multiple access</em>). There is a chance that two or more computers may attempt to broadcast a message at the same time; therefore, Ethernet systems must have the capability to detect data collisions (<em>collision detection</em>).</p>

        <p class="noindent">The information in an Ethernet network is exchanged in a <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key27" href="glossary.xhtml#glo219">frame</a></span></strong>, which groups the information for a transmission into a header, data, and a trailer. The header consists of the preamble, a start frame delimiter, destination and source addresses, and a length/type field. Next is the actual data being transmitted, followed by the padding used to bring the total number of bytes up to the minimum of 46 if the data field is less than 46 bytes. The last part of the frame is a 4-byte cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value used for error checking. The minimum length of an Ethernet frame is 64 bytes. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig07">Figure 1-7</a> shows the structure of an Ethernet packet frame, and <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab03">Table 1-3</a> describes the fields of the Ethernet frame.</p>

The first 6 digits are used to indicate the vendor of the network interface, also called the <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key30" href="glossary.xhtml#glo429">organizationally unique identifier (OUI)</a></span></strong>, and the last 6 numbers form a unique value for each NIC assigned by the vendor. IEEE is the worldwide source of registered OUIs. A searchable database of IEEE OUI and company ID assignments is available at <a href="http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt">http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt</a>. Large companies may have many OUIs assigned to them. For example, the OUI 00-AA-00 is only one of Intel’s many OUIs. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab04">Table 1-4</a> lists a few examples of MAC addresses.</p>

This is also how computer 1 and the printer communicate directly in the star topology example using the switch (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a>). The switch stores the MAC addresses of all devices connected to its ports and uses that information to forward the data from computer 1 directly to the printer. The switch also uses the MAC address information to forward the data from computer 5 to computer 6 (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04">Figure 1-4</a>).</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec5">IP Addressing</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A MAC address provides a physical address for a network interface card but provides no information about its network location or even on what LAN or in which building, city, or country the network resides. Internet Protocol (IP) addressing provides a solution to worldwide addressing by incorporating a unique address that identifies the computer’s local network. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (<strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key33" href="glossary.xhtml#glo265">IANA</a></span></strong>) is an agency that assigns IP addresses to computer networks and makes sure no two different networks are assigned the same IP network address. The web address for IANA is <a href="http://www.iana.org">www.iana.org</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">IP version 4 (IPv4) is the TCP/IP addressing technique that has been used on the Internet for a number of years. However, the available IPv4 address space has been exhausted due to the rapid growth of the Internet and the development of new Internet-compatible technologies. Version 6 (IPv6) adoption has grown steadily. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are being supported by manufacturers of networking equipment and the latest computer operating systems. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>, “<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">TCP/IP</a>,” provides details on IPv6. Despite the rise in IPv6 addressing, IPv4 addressing is currently the most common method for assigning IP addresses. This text refers to IPv4 addressing as simply “IP addressing.” An <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key34" href="glossary.xhtml#glo291">IP address</a></span></strong> is a 32-bit address that identifies on which network a computer is located and differentiates the computer from all other devices on that network. The address is divided into four 8-bit parts. The format for the IP address is as follows:</p>

The range for each of the decimal values is 0–255. IP addresses can be categorized by class. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab06">Table 1-6</a> provides examples of the classes of IP networks, and <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab07">Table 1-7</a> shows the address range for each class.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The process of setting up a home network, as you likely know, can be quite challenging. One of the first issues to determine is whether to set up a wired or wireless home network. A <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key43" href="glossary.xhtml#glo684">wired network</a></span></strong> uses cabling and connectors to establish network connections. A <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key44" href="glossary.xhtml#glo685">wireless network</a></span></strong> uses radio signals to establish network connections.

The router can also contain a switch and a broadband modem. The switch is used to interconnect other networking devices, and the broadband modem is used to make the data connection to the ISP. Its physical ports that interconnect other local network devices may sometimes be labeled as LAN ports, and a physical port that connects to the ISP may be labeled as a WAN port, depending on the manufacturer. The most common broadband connections to the ISP are via a cable modem and DSL. A cable modem connection is sometimes called a cable broadband connection. In some cases the router, switch, and broadband modem are separate devices, but most often they are integrated into one device. One of the computers in a network may also have the configuration settings for managing the router, which can include the settings for connecting to the ISP.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Several issues should be considered when planning for a home network, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Data speed:</strong> The data speed is determined by whether you chose to implement a wired or wireless home network. Wired networks offer the best data transfer rate inside the home network, up to 10Gbps. The best data transfer rates for a wireless home network can be obtained using 802.11ax technology. This is the latest generation of high-speed wireless connectivity, providing single-station data transfer rates of 3Gbps.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Cost:</strong> Implementing a high-speed wired network can be quite expensive. With the networking hardware, cabling, and related hardware, you can incur unexpected additional costs in implementing a high-speed wired home network. The cost of switching to or implementing a Wireless-ac network is minimal, and such a network is a suitable alternative to a wired network. But remember that the maximum data rate in a Wireless-ac network is still much lower than the possible maximum data rate in a wired LAN.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"></span><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> A wireless home network is probably the easiest to implement if the cabling and connectors for a wired network are not already installed. The time required to install a wireless home network is usually minimal as long as unexpected problems do not surface.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Appearance:</strong> A wireless home network is the best choice in regard to appearance because cables and networking hardware do not need to be scattered around the house. A wireless home network requires a wireless router and an external wired connection to the ISP (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig10">Figure 1-10</a>(b)).</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Home access:</strong> The choice of wired or wireless technology does not affect home access. However, while a wired network offers the best data transfer speed internal to the network, a wireless network offers the best choice for mobility.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Public access:</strong> The choice of wired or wireless technology does not impact public access. The data rate for the connection to/from the ISP is the limiting factor for the data transfer rate for public access.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">It is not uncommon for a wired or wireless home network to stop functioning, although the downtime is usually minimal. The steps for troubleshooting wired and wireless home networks include the following:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="num">Check the networking device that connects your network to your ISP to ensure that the proper lights are displayed. Incorrect lights can indicate a connection problem with your cable modem, DSL modem, or telephone connection. Your ISP might also be having a problem, and you might need to call the ISP to verify your connection.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Reboot the host computer (the computer connected to the router) and reboot the router. This usually fixes the problem, and the correct lights should be displayed. In some cases, you might also have to power down your broadband modem and then power it up again. (Remember that the broadband modem might be integrated with the router.) Once again, check to see whether the correct lights are being displayed.</p></li>
        <li><p class="num">Verify that your hardware cable or phone connection is in place and has not been pulled loose. Make corrections as needed. You should also verify that all wireless units have network connections. Use the following steps to verify wireless connectivity for Windows 10 or macOS:</p>
        <ul class="bullet1">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center</strong>. The wireless connection appears as enabled if there is a wireless connection.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>macOS:</strong> Go to <strong>System Preferences &gt; Network</strong>. Select the network adapter from the left window and click <strong>Advanced &gt; Hardware</strong>. Look for the following indicators:</p>
        <ul class="bullet1">
        <li><p class="bull">If you are connected, the Wi-Fi status displays <strong>Connected</strong> with a green indicator.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"></span>If the wireless Wi-Fi is on but is not connected to a network, the Wi-Fi status displays <strong>On</strong> with an amber indicator.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull">If the Wi-Fi is off, the Wi-Fi status displays <strong>Off</strong> with a red indicator.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bull">Also note that if you are connected to a wireless network, a radio wave icon appears at the top of the screen in the menu bar to indicate that you are connected to a wireless network.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">The following are the basic steps for establishing a wireless connection for a wireless notebook computer running Windows 10 or macOS:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Set Up a New Connection or Network</strong>. You need to choose the <strong>Connect to the Internet</strong> option and then select <strong>Wireless</strong> to establish a wireless connection.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>macOS:</strong> Go to <strong>System Preferences &gt; Network</strong>. Select the network adapter from the left window, select the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> connection, and then click <strong>Turn Wi-Fi On</strong>. The available wireless networks appear under the <strong>Network Name</strong> drop-down menu. Select a desired wireless network and enter the WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3 password when prompted. If you are connected, a radio wave should appear at the top of the screen in the menu bar, indicating that the network is connected.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">There are many choices of wireless technologies for configuring a wireless network. The 802.11b, g, n, ac, and ax technologies are compatible with one another even though they offer different data speeds. If compatible but different wireless technologies are being used, the data transfer speeds are negotiated at the rate specified by the slowest technology. For example, the 802.11n (that is, Wireless-N) standard offers a faster data rate than 802.11g (that is, Wireless-G), but when devices of both technologies are present, the data transfer rate is negotiated at the Wireless-G data rate.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec8"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"></span>Securing a Home Network</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Many potential security issues are associated with wireless networks. Securing a wireless home network is extremely important because if a wireless signal is intercepted by the wrong person, that person can possibly connect to the network. The following are some basic measures you can take to help protect a home network:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Change the default factory passwords.</strong> Home network equipment often ships with default passwords that are set at the factory. These default settings are known by the public, including people who would like to gain access to your network and possibly change your settings. It is best to select your own password that is a combination of alphanumeric characters.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Enable MAC address filtering (MAC filtering).</strong> Every computer device has a unique MAC address that identifies the device. This address can be used to select which devices can be allowed access to the network. When MAC address filtering (MAC filtering) is turned on, only wireless devices that have specific MAC addresses are allowed access to the network.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Change the default SSID.</strong> The <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key49" href="glossary.xhtml#glo539">service set identifier (SSID)</a></span></strong> is the name used to identify your network that is used by your access point or wireless router to establish an association. Establishing an association means that a wireless client can join the network. The SSID can be up to 32 characters and should be changed often so hackers who have figured out your SSID no longer have access to your home network.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Service Set Identifier (SSID)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A name that is used to identify your wireless network and is used by your access point or wireless router to establish an association</p>
        </div></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Turn on encryption.</strong> It is important to turn on security features such as data encryption. These options include Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), WPA2, and WPA3. WPA2 is a product certification issued by the Wi-Fi Alliance that uses a stronger encryption than WPA and is also backward compatible with adapters using WPA. WPA3, which is the latest Wi-Fi security standard, is interoperable with WPA2 devices. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) simplifies the configuration process, enabling the user to set up a WPA pre-shared key (PSK) without having to enter a long string of symbols, random numbers, or letters. Although WPS helps protect wireless networks, it is susceptible to brute-force attacks.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Turn off the SSID broadcast.</strong> Wireless systems broadcast the SSID so that a network can be easily identified as an available network. Hackers can use this information to possibly gain access to a network, so you should turn off the SSID broadcast. The exception to this is in hotspots where public access is available. Note that hotspots make it easy for the user to gain wireless access, but hackers can also be on the same network, so it is important to have encryption turned on.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"></span>Another important security concern is limiting outside access to your home network via your connection to the ISP. The following are some things you can do to protect a home network from outside threats:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Network address translation (NAT):</strong> With NAT, an outsider sees only the router’s ISP-assigned IP address, and the IP addresses of the internal networking devices are not provided on the Internet. A home network typically uses a private address that is not routable on the Internet. (Private IP addresses are blocked by the ISP.)</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Firewall protection:</strong> A common practice is to turn on <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key50" href="glossary.xhtml#glo213">firewall protection</a></span></strong>. The purpose of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized access to a network. Firewall protection is available in both the Windows and macOS operating environments. A type of firewall protection is <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key51" href="glossary.xhtml#glo585">stateful packet inspection (SPI)</a></span></strong>. This type of protection involves inspecting incoming data packets to make sure they correspond to an outgoing request. For example, if you are exchanging information with a website, data packets that are not requested may be rejected. Firewalls are covered in more detail in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, “<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Network Security</a>.”</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>VPN connections for transferring sensitive information:</strong> A <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key52" href="glossary.xhtml#glo671">virtual private network (VPN)</a></span></strong> establishes a secure network connection and helps protect a LAN’s data from being observed by outsiders. The VPN connection capability is available with Windows 10 and macOS. A VPN connection enables a remote or mobile user to access the network as if he or she were actually physically at the network. In addition, the VPN connection is encrypted, providing privacy for the data packets being transmitted.</p></li>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch1lev2sec9">IP Addressing in a Home Network</h4>
        <p class="noindent">How is IP addressing handled for all the computers connected to the Internet? A home network typically has only one connection to the ISP, but multiple computers can be connected to the Internet at the same time. IP addressing for a home network is managed by the router or wireless router that connects to the ISP. (<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig19">Figure 1-19</a> provides an example of a wireless router that connects to an ISP.)</p>
        <figure class="image" id="ch01fig19">

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="noindent">The ISP issues an IP address to the router from an available pool of IP addresses managed by the ISP. The computers in the home network are issued private IP addresses via a DHCP program on the home router (applicable ranges are 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255). These private IP addresses are translated into the ISP’s assigned IP address using <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key53" href="glossary.xhtml#glo399">network address translation (NAT)</a></span></strong>.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Network Address Translation (NAT)</p>
        <p class="box-para">A technique that involves translating a private IP address to a public address for routing over the Internet</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">The routable public IP address that the ISP issues for the wireless router enables all computers in the home network to access the Internet. The wireless router issues private addresses to all computers connected to the network.</p>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"></span>
        <p class="noindent">You can use NAT to translate a private IP address to a public address for routing over the Internet. For example, computer 1 in the home network shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig20">Figure 1-20</a> might establish a connection to an Internet website. The wireless router uses NAT to translate computer 1’s private IP address (192.168.0.64) to the public IP address (128.123.246.55) assigned to the router. The router uses a technique called <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key54" href="glossary.xhtml#glo437">overloading</a></span></strong>, in which NAT translates the home network’s private IP addresses to the single public IP address assigned by the ISP. In addition, the NAT process tracks a port number for the connection; this technique is called <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key55" href="glossary.xhtml#glo466">port address translation (PAT)</a></span></strong>. The router stores the home network’s IP address and port number in a NAT lookup table. The port number differentiates the computer that is establishing a connection to the Internet because the router uses the same address for all computers. This port number is used when a data packet is returned to the home network. The port number identifies the computer that established the Internet connection, and the router can deliver the data packet to the correct computer. Another application of NAT is <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key56" href="glossary.xhtml#glo468">port forwarding</a></span></strong> (also called <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a href="glossary.xhtml#glo468">port mapping</a></span></strong>), in which packets from one IP address/port number are redirected to another. This process is often used to make services on one part of a network available to hosts on the opposite side of the network.</p>

First, the network enables the data packet to be routed back to the home network. Next, the router uses the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"></span>NAT lookup table and port number to translate the destination for the data packet back to the computer 1 private IP address and original port number, which might be different.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig20">Figure 1-20</a> shows an example of the NAT process for a home network. The home network has been assigned Class C private IP addresses (192.168.0.<em>x</em>) by the router. The <em>x</em> is a unique number (from 1 to 254) assigned to each computer. The router translates the private IP addresses to the public routable IP address assigned by the ISP. In addition, the router tracks a port number with the public IP address to identify the computer. For example, the computer with the private IP address 192.168.0.64 is assigned the public IP address 128.123.246.55:1962, where 1962 is the port number tracked by the router.</p>

In this example, the Ethernet protocol is used for managing the exchange of data in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"></span>network, and the networking devices are interconnected in a star (also called hub-and-spoke) topology. There are many options for assembling and configuring a LAN; this example presents a networking approach that is simple and consistent with modern computer networking. It also provides a good introduction to the networking topics presented throughout this book.</p>
        <p class="noindent">For this example, three computers and one printer are configured in a star topology.

You can view the MAC addresses by entering the <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> command at the command prompt in Windows 10 (see <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab09">Table 1-9</a>). Repeat this step for all computing devices connected to the LAN. Each networking device should be assigned an IP address, and <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab09">Table 1-9</a> also lists the IP addresses planned for the devices in this office LAN.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The next step in assembling an office-type LAN is to connect all the networking devices by using the star topology shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig21">Figure 1-21</a>. At the center of this star topology network is a switch or hub. Recall that either a switch or a hub can be used to connect the networking devices. The switch is the best choice in this case because a hub broadcasts data it receives to all devices connected to its ports, and a switch enables the devices to communicate directly. Although hubs are not as sophisticated as switches and are not used often in modern computer networking, they are still suitable for use in small networks.</p>

A straight-through port, also called an <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key63" href="glossary.xhtml#glo654">uplink port</a></span></strong>, allows for the connection of a switch to a switch or hub without the use of a special cable.

        <li><p class="bull"><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet—Network and Sharing Center</strong>. Click <strong>Local Area Connection</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong> and then click <strong>Continue</strong>. In the Local Area Connection Properties menu, double-click <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong>. From the Properties menu, select <strong>Use the Following IP Address</strong>, enter the IP address and subnet mask, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bull"><strong>macOS:</strong> Go to <strong>System Preferences &gt; Network</strong>. Select the network adapter from the left window and select the <strong>Ethernet</strong> or <strong>USB Ethernet</strong> connection. From the Configure IPv4 drop-down menu, select <strong>Manually</strong>. (This option lets you manually set the IP address and subnet mask.) Enter the desired IP address and subnet mask in the fields that now appear and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">As shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01tab09">Table 1-9</a>, the IP address for computer 1 is 10.10.10.1, and in this example, the subnet mask 255.255.0.0 is being used. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a> examines subnet masking in detail. For now, leave the remaining fields empty; you’ll learn more about them in later chapters. Your network configuration for computer 1 should now be complete, and you can repeat these steps for computers 2 and 3 in this LAN example.</p>

        <p class="noindent">When the network configurations on the computers are completed and the cable connections are in place, you need to test and possibly troubleshoot the network. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46"></span>First, you need to verify that the computers are properly connected on the network. You do this by verifying that you have link lights on the switch ports connected to a computer or other networking device. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig26">Figure 1-26</a> shows an example of a switch with link lights activated.</p>
        <figure class="image" id="ch01fig26">

        <p class="noindent">After you have verified that the networking devices are physically connected, you can use the <strong>ping</strong> command in the Windows command window to verify that the devices are communicating. <strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key71" href="glossary.xhtml#glo460">ping</a></span></strong> uses Internet Control Message Protocol (<strong><span class="gray_kt"><a id="ch1key72" href="glossary.xhtml#glo268">ICMP</a></span></strong>) echo requests and replies to test that a device on the network is reachable. The ICMP protocol verifies that messages are being delivered. The command structure for the <strong>ping</strong> command is as follows:</p>
