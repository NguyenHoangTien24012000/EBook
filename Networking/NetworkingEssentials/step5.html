        <p class="noindent">The utility of LANs led to the desire to connect two or more networks together. For example, a large corporation might have at one time had separate networks for research and engineering and another network for its manufacturing units. These network systems probably used totally different networking technologies and specifications for communicating and were located in different cities, states, or even countries, but it was deemed necessary to “tie” them together. The objective of this and subsequent chapters is to introduce the concepts and issues involved in interconnecting LANs. Interconnecting LANs in a campus network and interconnecting LANs in wide area networks (WANs) involve similar concepts and issues. A <a id="ch5key1" href="glossary.xhtml#glo81"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>campus network</strong></span></a> is a collection of two or more interconnected LANs, either within a building or housed externally in multiple buildings.</p>

        <h3 class="h3" id="ch5lev1sec1"><span class="space">5-1</span> Introduction</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The OSI model provides a framework that defines the network layers for linking networks together (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a>, “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Introduction to Computer Networks</a>”). The OSI model ensures compatibility in the network hardware and software. Concepts related to the hardware technologies used to interconnect LANs are presented in in this chapter. The properties of a networking bridge are defined in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec2">Section 5-2</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec2">The Network Bridge</a>.” The layer 2 switch is examined in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec3">Section 5-3</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec3">The Network Switch</a>,” and the router is introduced in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec4">Section 5-4</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec4">The Router</a>.” The procedure for configuring a router through the router’s console port is presented in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec5">Section 5-5</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec5">The Console Port Connection</a>.” This section provides an overview of configuring a computer’s serial communication software and selecting the proper cable and hardware for connecting the console port to a computer. An example of interconnecting LANs is provided in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec6">Section 5-6</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec6">Interconnecting LANs with the Router</a>,” which examines how routers can be used to interconnect LANs. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec7">Section 5-7</a>, “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5lev1sec7">Interconnecting LANs and WANs</a> introduces well-known LAN architecture, data center architecture, and WAN technologies such as high-speed serial connections and Metro Optical Ethernet that are used to connect LANs or to connect the enterprise network to the outside world.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231"></span><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05tab01">Table 5-1</a> outlines the CompTIA Network+ objectives related to this chapter and identifies the chapter section that covers each objective. At the end of each chapter section you will find a review with comments on the Network+ objectives presented in that section. These comments are provided to help reinforce your understanding of each Network+ objective. The chapter review also includes “Test Your Knowledge” questions to help you understand key concepts before you advance to the next section of the chapter. At the end of the chapter you will find a complete set of questions as well as sample certification exam-type questions.</p>

        <p class="noindent">A bridge can be used in computer networks to interconnect two LANs or separate network segments. Recall that a <em>segment</em> is a section of a network separated by bridges, switches, and routers. A <a id="ch5key2" href="glossary.xhtml#glo67"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>bridge</strong></span></a> is a layer 2 device in the OSI model, meaning that it uses MAC address information to make decisions regarding forwarding of data packets. Only the data that needs to be sent across a bridge to the adjacent network segment is forwarded. This makes it possible to isolate or segment the network data traffic. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig01">Figure 5-1</a> provides an example of using a bridge to segment two Ethernet LANs. It shows LAN A connected to port 1 on the bridge and LAN B connected to port 2 on the bridge, creating two segments. There are four computers in LAN A and three computers in LAN B. It is important to note that bridges are now legacy networking devices, but studying them will help you better understand the functionality of switches, especially how data traffic is sent to connected LANs.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233"></span>The source MAC address is stored in the bridge table as soon as a host talks (that is, transmits a data packet) on the LAN. In the example shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig01">Figure 5-1</a>, if computer 1 in LAN A sends a message to computer 2, the bridge will store the MAC addresses of both computers and record that both of the computers are connected to port 1. If computers 5 or 6 are placing data packets on the network, then the source MAC addresses for computers 5 and 6 are stored in the bridge table, and it is recorded that these computers connect to port 2 on the bridge. The MAC addresses for computers 3 and 4 will not be added to the bridge table until each transmits a data packet.</p>

        <p class="box-title">Association</p>
        <p class="box-para">An indication that the destination address is for a networking device connected to one of the ports on a bridge</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">The bridge monitors the data on its ports to check for an <a id="ch5key4" href="glossary.xhtml#glo46"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>association</strong></span></a> between the destination MAC address of the Ethernet frames and any of the hosts connected to its ports. An association indicates that the destination MAC address for a host is connected to one of the ports on the bridge. If an association is found, the data is forwarded to that port. In the example shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig01">Figure 5-1</a>, say that computer 1 sends a message to computer 5. The bridge detects an association between the destination MAC address for computer 5 and port 2. The bridge then forwards the data from computer 1 to computer 5 in LAN B via port 2.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The capability of a bridge to forward data packets only when there is an association is used to isolate data traffic in each segment. For example, say that computer 1 and computer 2 in LAN A generate a lot of data traffic. The computers in LAN B will not see any of the data traffic as long as there is not an association between the destination MAC addresses of the Ethernet packets and any of the hosts in LAN B (computers 5, 6, and 7).</p>
        <p class="noindent">A potential problem with bridges is related to the way broadcasts are handled. With a <a id="ch5key5" href="glossary.xhtml#glo70"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>broadcast</strong></span></a>, a message is sent to all computers on the network; therefore, all broadcasts in a LAN will be forwarded to all hosts connected within the bridged LANs. For example, the broadcast associated with ARP will appear on all hosts. <a id="ch5key6" href="glossary.xhtml#glo22"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ARP</strong></span></a>, which stands for Address Resolution Protocol, is a protocol used to map an IP address to its MAC address. With ARP, a broadcast is sent to all hosts in a LAN connected to the bridge, as illustrated in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig02">Figure 5-2</a>. The bridge forwards all broadcasts; therefore, an ARP request broadcasting the message “Who has this IP address?” is sent to all hosts on the LAN. The data packets associated with ARP requests are small, but computer time is needed to process each request. Excessive numbers of broadcasts being forwarded by the bridge can lead to a <a id="ch5key7" href="glossary.xhtml#glo72"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>broadcast storm</strong></span></a>, resulting in degraded network performance, called a <a id="ch5key8" href="glossary.xhtml#glo405"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>network slowdown</strong></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The MAC address entries stored in a bridge table are temporary. Each MAC address entry in a bridge table remains active as long as there is periodic data traffic activity from that host on its port. However, an entry into the table is deleted if the port becomes inactive. In other words, the entries stored in the table have limited lifetimes. An expiration timer commences once the MAC address is entered into the bridge table. The lifetime for the entry is renewed with new data traffic by the computer, and the MAC address is reentered.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In a similar manner, every networking device (such as a computer) contains an <a id="ch5key9" href="glossary.xhtml#glo39"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ARP cache</strong></span></a>, also called an <a id="ch5key10" href="glossary.xhtml#glo42"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>ARP table</strong></span></a>, which provides temporary storage for MAC addresses recently contacted. The ARP cache holds the MAC address of a host and enables the message to be sent directly to the destination MAC address without the computer having to issue an ARP request for a MAC address. The following are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234"></span>typical steps in the communication process between two computers, computer 1 and computer 2:</p>
        <ol class="number">
        <li><p class="num">Computer 1 checks its ARP cache to determine if it already has the MAC address of computer 2. If it does, it skips to step 6; otherwise, it proceeds to step 2.</p></li>

        <li><p class="num">Every local network device processes the ARP request message. Computers that are not computer 2 discard the message. Only a match, which is computer 2, generates an ARP reply message and updates its ARP cache with computer 1 MAC and IP address information.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">A bridge can be used to isolate the collision domains for interconnected LANs but lacks the capability to provide a direct data connection for the hosts. A bridge forwards the data traffic to all computers connected to its port (refer to <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig02">Figure 5-2</a>). A networking hub makes it possible to share access to the network with all computers connected to its ports in the LAN but lacks the capability to isolate the data traffic and provide a direct data connection from the source to the destination computer. The increase in the number of computers being used in LANs and the increased data traffic are limiting the usefulness of bridges and hubs in larger LANs. Basically, there is too much data traffic to be shared by the entire network. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238"></span>Most situations call for a networking device that provides a direct data connection between communicating devices. Neither the bridge nor the hub provides a direct data connection for the hosts. A technology developed to improve the efficiency of data networks and address the need for direct data connections is the layer 2 switch.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A <a id="ch5key13" href="glossary.xhtml#glo318"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>layer 2 switch</strong></span></a> is an improved network technology that addresses the issues of providing direct data connections, minimizing data collisions, and maximizing the use of a LAN’s bandwidth; in other words, a layer 2 switch improves the efficiency of the data transfer in the network. It operates at layer 2 of the OSI model and therefore uses the MAC or Ethernet address for making decisions related to forwarding data packets. The switch monitors data traffic on its ports and collects MAC address information in the same way a bridge does to build a table of MAC addresses for the devices connected to its ports. Much like a hub, a switch has multiple ports; much like a bridge, a switch can switch in a data connection from any port to any other port (and, therefore, a switch is sometimes called a <a id="ch5key14" href="glossary.xhtml#glo385"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>multiport bridge</strong></span></a>). A switch minimizes traffic congestion and isolates data traffic in the LAN.</p>

The change from a hub to a switch is relatively easy. The port connections are the same (RJ-45), and once the connections are changed and the device is powered on, the switch begins to make the direct data connections for multiple ports by using layer 2 switching.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The LAN shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig05">Figure 5-5</a> contains 14 computers and 2 printers connected to 16 ports on a switch, configured in a star topology. If the computer connected to port 1 is printing a file on the laser printer (port 12), the switch sets up a direct connection between ports 1 and 12. The computer at port 14 could also be communicating with the computer at port 7, and the computer at port 6 could be printing a file on the color printer at port 16. The use of the switch enables simultaneous direct data connections for multiple pairs of hosts connected to the network. Each switch connection provides a link with minimal collisions and therefore makes maximum use of the LAN’s bandwidth. A link with minimal collisions is possible because only the two computers that established the link communicate over the channel.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_239"></span>Recall that in the star topology, each host has a direct connection to the switch. Therefore, when the link is established between the two hosts, this link is isolated from any other data traffic. However, there is an exception to this when broadcast or <a id="ch5key15" href="glossary.xhtml#glo377"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>multicast</strong></span></a> messages are sent in the LAN. In the case of a broadcast message, the message is sent to all devices connected to the LAN. A multicast message is sent to a specific group of hosts on the network.</p>

        <p class="noindent">An experiment was set up to test the data handling characteristics of a hub and a switch, given the same input instructions. The objective of this experiment was to show that data traffic is isolated with a switch but not with a hub. For this experiment, a LAN using a hub and a LAN using a switch were assembled. The LANs are shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig06">Figure 5-6</a>. Each LAN contains four computers connected in a star topology. The computers are numbered 1–4 for reference. The IP addresses are listed for each host.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Hub Experiment Results</h5>
        <p class="noindent">In this experiment, computer 1 pinged computer 3. Computer 2 was used to capture the LAN data traffic using a network protocol analyzer. What are the expected results? Remember that a hub is a multiport repeater, and all data traffic input to the hub is passed on to all hosts connected to its ports. (See the “<strong>ping</strong> Command Review” section that follows for a brief review of the use of the <strong>ping</strong> command.)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">ping Command Review</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The <strong>ping</strong> command is used to verify that a network connection exists between two computers. The command format for <strong>ping</strong> is:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">ping [<em>ip address</em>]</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This example uses the following command:</p>
        <pre class="pre1">ping 10.10.10.3</pre>
        <p class="noindent">After a link is established between the two computers, a series of echo requests and echo replies are issued by the networking devices to determine how much time it takes for data to pass through the link. The protocol used by the <strong>ping</strong> command is Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).</p>
        <p class="noindent">The <strong>ping</strong> command is issued to an IP address; however, delivery of this command to the computer designated by the IP address requires that a MAC address be identified for final delivery. The computer issuing the <strong>ping</strong> might not know the MAC address of the computer holding the identified IP address (if it has no entry in the ARP cache table); therefore, an ARP request is issued. An ARP request is broadcast to all computers connected in the LAN. The computer that holds the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_241"></span>IP address replies with its MAC address, and a direct line of communication is then established.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig07">Figure 5-7</a> shows the data traffic collected by computer 2 when computer 1 pinged computer 3. The first line of the captured data shows the ARP request, asking who has the IP address 10.10.10.3. The second line of the captured data shows the reply from 10.10.10.3 with the MAC address 00-B0-D0-25-BF-48. The next eight lines in the captured data are the series of four echo requests and replies associated with a <strong>ping</strong> request. Even though computer 2 was not being pinged and was not replying to the ARP request, the data traffic was still present on computer 2’s hub port. The echo reply is from a Dell network interface card whose MAC address ends with the six characters 25-BF-48. The echo request is coming from a computer with 13-99-2E as the last six hex characters of its MAC address.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Switch Experiment Results</h5>
        <p class="noindent">The same experiment just described was repeated for the LAN shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig06">Figure 5-6</a>(b), this time using a switch instead of a hub to interconnect the computers. This network consists of four computers connected in a star topology, using a switch at the center of the network. The <strong>ping</strong> command <strong>ping 10.10.10.3</strong> was sent from computer 1 to computer 3. The ARP cache for computer 1 is empty; therefore, the MAC address for computer 3 is not known by computer 1. An ARP request is issued by computer 1, and computer 3 replies. The series of echo requests and echo replies follow; however, the data traffic captured by computer 2 (see <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig08">Figure 5-8</a>) shows the ARP request asking who has the IP address 10.10.10.3. This is the last of the data communications between computers 1 and 3 that is seen by computer 2. A direct line of communication between computers 1 and 3 is established by the switch and prevents computer 2 from seeing the data traffic from computers 1 and 3. The only data traffic seen by computer 2 in this process is the broadcast of the ARP request. This is true for any other hosts in the LAN.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242"></span>This experiment shows that the use of the switch substantially reduces data traffic—particularly unnecessary data traffic—in the LAN. The experiment shows that the broadcast associated with an ARP request is seen by all computers, but the ARP replies in a LAN using a switch are not seen. This is because a direct data connection is established between the two hosts. This experiment used pings and ARP requests; however, this same advantage of using a switch occurs when transferring files, downloading images, printing files, and so on. The data traffic is isolated from other computers on the LAN. Remember that the switch uses MAC addresses to establish which computers are connected to its ports. The switch then extracts the destination MAC address from the Ethernet data packets to determine to which port to switch the data.</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246"></span>There are many benefits to using a network switch in a modern computer network. These benefits include less network congestion, faster data transfers, and excellent manageability. A network switch can be used to replace a network hub, and the advantage is that data traffic within a LAN is isolated. The term for this is <a id="ch5key22" href="glossary.xhtml#glo310"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>isolating the collision domains</strong></span></a>, which means breaking the network into segments. A <em>segment</em> is a portion of a network where the data traffic from one part of the network is isolated from the other networking devices. A direct benefit of isolating collision domains is that doing so increases the data transfer speed and improves bandwidth/throughput. This is due to the fact that the LAN bandwidth is not being shared and the chances of data collisions are minimized. As a result, the LAN will exhibit faster data transfers and significantly reduced latency. Reduced latency means that the data packets arrive at the destination more quickly.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected networks by extracting MAC address information from the headers of transmitted data packets. A switch maps the extracted MAC address to the port where the data packet came in. This information is stored in <a id="ch5key23" href="glossary.xhtml#glo120"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>content-addressable memory (CAM)</strong></span></a>—a table of MAC address and port mapping that the switch uses to identify connected networking devices. The switch then uses the extracted MAC addresses to map direct communication between two network devices connected to its ports. The MAC address and port information remain in CAM as long as the device connected to the switch port remains active. A timestamp establishes the time when the mapping of the MAC address to a switch port is established. However, switches limit the amount of time address and port information are stored in CAM. As mentioned earlier in this section, this is called <em>aging time</em>. The mapping information is deleted from the switch’s CAM if there is no activity during this set time. This technique keeps the mapping information stored in CAM up to date.</p>
        <p class="noindent">What happens if the destination MAC address is not stored in CAM? In this case, the packet is transmitted out all switch ports except for the port where the packet was received in a process called <a id="ch5key24" href="glossary.xhtml#glo216"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>flooding</strong></span></a>.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Switches minimize the collision domain due to the fact that a direct switch connection is made between networking devices. However, it is important to remember that switches do not reduce the broadcast domain. In a <a id="ch5key25" href="glossary.xhtml#glo71"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>broadcast domain</strong></span></a>, any network broadcast sent over the network will be seen by all networking devices in the same network. Broadcasts within a LAN are passed by switches. (Refer to the discussion of <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig07">Figures 5-7</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig08">5-8</a> for an example.)</p>
        <p class="noindent">A switch can use three modes to forward frames:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><a id="ch5key26" href="glossary.xhtml#glo591"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Store-and-forward</strong></span></a><strong>:</strong> In this mode, an entire frame of data is received before any decision is made regarding forwarding the data packet to its destination. There is switch latency in this mode because the destination and source MAC addresses must be extracted from the packet, and the entire packet must be received before it is sent to the destination. The term <a id="ch5key27" href="glossary.xhtml#glo601"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>switch latency</strong></span></a> refers to the amount of time a data packet takes from the time it enters a switch until it exits. An advantage of the store-and-forward mode is that the switch checks the data packet for errors before sending it on to the destination. A disadvantage is that lengthy data packets take a longer time before they exit the switch and are sent to the destination.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Newer switch technologies, including <a id="ch5key31" href="glossary.xhtml#glo381"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>multilayer switches (MLSs)</strong></span></a>, are available to help further improve the performance of computer networks. An example of a multilayer switch is a layer 3 switch. Layer 3 switches still work at layer 2 but also work at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model and use IP addressing for making decisions about routing a data packet in the best direction. The major difference is that the packet switching in basic routers is handled by a programmed microprocessor. A layer 3 switch uses application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware to handle the packet switching. The advantage of using hardware to handle the packet switching is a significant reduction in processing time compared to using software for packet switching. In fact, the processing time of layer 3 switches can be as fast as the input data rate. With <a id="ch5key32" href="glossary.xhtml#glo683"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>wire speed routing</strong></span></a>, the data packets are processed as fast as they are arriving. Multilayer switches can also work at the upper layers of the OSI model. For example, a layer 4 switch may process data packets at the transport layer of the OSI model.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The router is the most powerful networking device used today to interconnect LANs. A router is a layer 3 device, which means it uses the <a id="ch5key33" href="glossary.xhtml#glo398"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>network address</strong></span></a> (layer 3 addressing) to make routing decisions regarding forwarding of data packets. Remember from <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a> that the OSI model separates network responsibilities into different layers. In the OSI model, layer 3, which is the network layer, is responsible for handling the network address. A network address is also called a <em>logical address</em>. Whereas a <em>physical address</em> is the hardware or MAC address embedded into a network interface card, a <a id="ch5key34" href="glossary.xhtml#glo338"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>logical address</strong></span></a> describes the IP address location of the network and the address location of the host in the network.</p>
        <div class="box">
        <p class="box-title">Network Address</p>
        <p class="box-para">A layer 3 address</p>

        <p class="box-para">The IP address location of a network and the address location of a host in a network</p>
        </div>
        <p class="noindent">Essentially, a router is configured to know how to route data packets entering or exiting a LAN. This differs from a bridge and a layer 2 switch, which use the Ethernet address for making decisions regarding forwarding data packets and only know how to forward data to hosts physically connected to their ports.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Routers are used to interconnect LANs in a campus network. Routers can be used to interconnect networks that use the same protocol (for example, Ethernet), or they can be used to interconnect LANs that use different layer 2 technologies, such as Ethernet and Token Ring. Routers also make it possible to interconnect to LANs around the country and the world and to interconnect many different networking protocols.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250"></span>A router has multiple port connections for connecting to LANs; by definition, a router must have a minimum of three ports. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig14">Figure 5-14</a> shows the symbol commonly used to represent a router in a network drawing. The arrows pointing in and out indicate that data enters and exits the routers through multiple ports. The router ports are <em>bidirectional,</em> meaning that data can enter and exit the same router port. Often router ports are called the <a id="ch5key35" href="glossary.xhtml#glo516"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>router interface</strong></span></a>, the physical connection where the router connects to the network.</p>

        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Console input:</strong> This input provides an RS-232 serial communications link into the router for initial router configuration. A special cable called a <em>console cable</em> is used to connect the console input to the serial port on a computer.

The console cable can also have an RJ-45 connector on one end and an integrated DB9 connector on the other end.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Auxiliary input:</strong> This input is used to connect a dial-in modem to the router. The auxiliary port provides an alternative way to remotely log in to the router if the network is down. This port also uses an RJ-45 connection.</p></li>

        <p class="noindent">The router shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig15">Figure 5-15</a> has many interface cards, most notably the voice interface cards, which can enable the router to also become a small VoIP (voice over IP) PBX and voice gateway. VoIP, also called IP telephony, is technology that transports phone conversations over IP networks. A PBX is a user’s own telephone system. It manages the internal switching of telephone calls and also interfaces the user’s phone to the PSTN (public switched telephone network—the telephone company [telco]). Standard telephones can also be used in IP telephony if the telephones connect to a PBX that supports IP telephony. The interface of the IP telephone system to the PSTN is called a <em>voice gateway</em>. The voice data needs to be packaged for transport over the IP network or the PSTN. The gateway also makes sure the proper signaling is included for the voice data packet transport. Signaling is used to establish and terminate telephone calls and to manage many of the advanced features available with telephones. Essentially, this router is capable of supporting VoIP phones and connecting the VoIP phones to external lines such as those of the local telephone company.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec9">Quality of Service</h4>
        <p class="noindent">An important issue in the delivery of real-time data over a network (such as with VoIP) is quality of service (QoS). QoS issues for a VoIP network include jitter, queuing/buffering, network latency and network congestion.</p>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252"></span>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Jitter</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Digitized voice data requires a fixed time interval between data packets for the signal to be properly converted back to an audible analog signal. However, there is a delay problem with voice data transported over a packet network. Variability in data packet arrival introduces jitter in the signal and leads to a poorly reconstructed signal at the receiver. For example, say that a 1000Hz tone is sent over a VoIP network. The tone is digitized at regular time intervals, assembled into frames and packets, and sent out as a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet. Random delays in the packets’ travel to the destination result in their arriving at irregular time intervals. The reproduced 1000Hz analog tone will contain jitter because the arrival times for the data packets will vary.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Queuing/Buffering</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Queuing/buffering the data packets long enough for the next data packet to arrive can help minimize the effects of jitter. A buffer is temporary storage for holding data packets until it is time for them to be sent. The buffer enables the data packets to be output at regular time intervals, thereby removing most of the jitter problem. Buffering works as long as the arrival time until the next packet is not too long. If a data packet arrives too late, it might have to be considered lost because real-time data packets can’t wait too long for the buffered packet without affecting the quality of the reconstructed signal. Another issue is that the buffering stage introduces delay, and having to wait additional time only introduces more delay.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Network Latency</h5>
        <p class="noindent">It takes time for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination. This time is called network latency, and it is an important issue with VoIP data traffic. Telephones (both traditional and IP) feed a portion of the user’s voice into the earpiece. If the round-trip delay of the voice data is too lengthy (more than 50 ms), the user will begin to hear an annoying echo in the earpiece.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h5 class="h5">Network Congestion</h5>
        <p class="noindent">Another source of packet delay is network congestion, which can have a negative effect on any type of data traffic but is especially disruptive to VoIP telephony. You must make sure that congestion problems are avoided or at least minimized. You may have the option of configuring routers to optimize routes for IP telephony.</p>
        <p class="noindent">You can minimize delay issues by making sure the network routers and switches are optimized for VoIP data traffic. You can configure a VoIP network so that high-priority data packets (for example, voice packets) are transported first over the IP network. In this case, non-sensitive data packets are given a low-priority status and are transmitted only after the high-priority packets are sent.</p>

        <h5 class="h5">Higher-end routers</h5>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig16">Figure 5-16</a> shows two Cisco ISR 4400 series routers, which provide adaptable interfaces for connecting to many physical layer technologies, such as Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, ATM, and a T1/E1 voice interface. This router is an example of a chassis-based network device that has a fixed number of slots for various types of line cards. Chassis-based network devices are configurable and easy to upgrade; it is also easy to replace their parts.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Some technologies require higher-end routers. One such technology is Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), a data-carrying technique used in telecommunications networks. It can encapsulate data packets from many network protocols—hence the term <em>multiprotocol</em>. MPLS assigns tags or labels to a certain type of traffic or network and then handles or switches these distinctive labeled packets across the service provider network backbone.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Another useful device for managing data traffic flow is a packet shaper, which is a device that sits between a campus network and the outside network. The device is set up so that all data traffic, incoming and outgoing, passes through it. A packet shaper can be used to set rules to limit download traffic from the Internet. It can also be used to make sure applications such as VoIP are given a higher priority so that the operation and quality of service are not affected.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The examples in this section are based on a router’s console port, but they apply to switches as well. A router’s console connection is a slow-speed serial communications link (9600bps) and is the only way to communicate with most routers until the router interfaces have been configured. Specifically, the console connection is an <a id="ch5key36" href="glossary.xhtml#glo528"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>RS-232</strong></span></a> serial communications port that uses an RJ-45 jack to connect to its interface. The RS-232 protocol running on the console port is the same communications protocol format used on a computer’s (COM1, COM2) port; however, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255"></span>connector for the serial communications port on the computer is either a <a id="ch5key37" href="glossary.xhtml#glo135"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>DB-9</strong></span></a> or <a id="ch5key38" href="glossary.xhtml#glo136"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>DB-25</strong></span></a> connector (although DB-25 connectors are seldom used). <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig17">Figure 5-17</a> shows drawings of the DB-9 and DB-25 connector ends. The DB-9 connection uses 9 pins, and the DB-25 connection uses 25 pins.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The connection from the router to the serial port on the computer requires a cable to be run from the computer’s serial port to the RJ-45 console jack input on the router. This can be accomplished using a cable with the DB-9 and RJ-45 plug ends, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig18">Figure 5-18</a>(a), or using an RJ-45 rollover cable and a DB-9 to RJ-45 adapter, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig18">Figure 5-18</a>(b). Serial connections are increasingly being replaced by USB connections. In such cases, the option is to use a USB to 9-pin RS-232 adapter, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig18">Figure 5-18</a>(c). A cable that connects the router’s console port to the computer’s serial port is called a <a id="ch5key39" href="glossary.xhtml#glo119"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>console cable</strong></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The next step is to set up the console connection from a computer to the router. This requires that one RJ-45 end of a rollover cable be connected to the console port in the back of the router. The other end of the cable connects to one of the 9-pin serial communication ports (COM ports) of the computer. It is important to note which serial port you connect to. You will have to specify the serial port (for example, COM1, COM2, and so on) when configuring the PuTTY serial communications software.</p>

After you change any settings you need to change, you can click <strong>Open</strong>, and the Cisco router screen is displayed. Press <strong>Enter</strong> to start the terminal communications. You should see a window like the one shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig22">Figure 5-22</a> when a connection has been established. If the window does not appear, press <strong>Enter</strong> to see whether the router resets itself. You might also see a screen with a <strong>Router&gt;</strong> prompt. In this case, press <strong>Enter</strong>, and if the <strong>Router&gt;</strong> prompt remains, you are connected.

This is called the HTTPS/management URL port. URL management allows you to connect to a network device via a web browser, using HTTPS to access the device’s IP address and its designated TCP port. For example, a manageable network switch with IP address 192.168.0.2 with designated management TCP port 8080 can be reached at <a href="https://192.168.0.2:8080">https://192.168.0.2:8080</a>. This would take you to the web page of the switch for configuration and management. The default IP address and the management port of the device are often specified in the setup instructions. URL management makes it easier for typical users to configure a network device without using a physical cable connection. Also, a lot of enterprise network equipment offers URL management for management and configuration as well.</p>

        <p class="noindent">As discussed earlier in this chapter, a router routes data based on the destination network address or logical address rather than the physical address used by layer 2 devices (for example, switches, bridges). Information exchanged with bridges and layer 2 switches requires that the MAC address for the hosts be known. Routed networks, such as most enterprise and campus networks, use IP addressing for managing data movement. <a id="ch5key42" href="glossary.xhtml#glo187"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Enterprise network</strong></span></a> is a term used to describe the network used by a large company. The use of the network or logical address on a computer enables the information to be sent from a LAN to a destination without requiring that the computer know the MAC address of the destination computer. Remember that delivery of data packets is based on knowing the MAC address of the destination.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="noindent">As discussed earlier in this chapter, the router interface provides a way to access a router for configuration either locally or remotely. Interfaces are provided for making serial connections to the router and to other devices that require serial communications links. For example, serial interfaces are needed for WAN devices. RJ-45 ports are provided on a router interface for connecting the router to a LAN. Older routers may require the use of an attachment unit interface (AUI) port to establish an Ethernet connection to a UTP cable. This port provides a 10Mbps data connection to Ethernet (10Mbps) networks. An RJ-45 connection is used to connect Ethernet (10Mbps), Fast Ethernet (100Mbps), Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps), and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10Gbps) to a LAN. Although an RJ-45 connection can support Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, high-speed data networks can also use a fiber connection.</p>
        <p class="noindent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig26">Figure 5-26</a> shows an example of a <a id="ch5key43" href="glossary.xhtml#glo353"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>media converter</strong></span></a> used to convert the 15-pin AUI port to the 8-pin RJ-45 connector. Media converters are commonly used in computer networks to adapt layer 1 or physical layer technologies from one technology to another. Examples include AUI to twisted pair (RJ-45), AUI to fiber, and RJ-45 to fiber.</p>

        <p class="noindent">When dealing with twisted-pair Ethernet cables, you must also understand the medium dependent interface (MDI) of the NIC of the device. Generally, routers and computers use an MDI interface, whereas switches use MDI-X (medium dependent interface crossover). In order for these two types of devices to communicate, the transmit pair pins on one end of the twisted-pair cable must connect to the receive pair pins on the other end. This is why you can use a straight-through twisted-pair cable to connect a router or a computer to a switch, as discussed in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a>, “<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2">Physical Layer Cabling: Twisted-Pair</a>.” Today, many NICs and network devices are equipped with the Auto-MDI-X (auto-medium-dependent interface crossover) feature, which detects the crossover and changes its interface to MDI or MDI-X automatically.</p>

In LAN B, a switch connects B1 and B2 from port 14 and port 21. In LAN C, the switch connects C1 from port 14 and C2 is connected from the port 23 labeled, "LAN C server." In LAN D, a switch connects D1 from port D1 and D2. From port 24, in LAN A, the data is transmitted to router A through the fast Ethernet FA0/0 with IP address 10.10.20.0 Net.

        <p class="noindent">The network configuration shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig27">Figure 5-27</a> enables data packets to be sent and received from any host on the network after the routers in the network have been properly configured. For example, computer A1 in LAN A could be sending data to computer D1 in LAN D. This requires that the IP address for computer D1 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_265"></span>be known by the user sending the data from computer A1. The data from computer A1 first travels to the switch where the data is passed to RouterA via the FA0/0 data port. RouterA examines the network address of the data packet and uses configured routing instructions stored in routing tables to decide where to forward the data. RouterA determines an available path to RouterC via the FA0/2 port connection. The data is then sent directly to RouterC. RouterC determines that the data packet should be forwarded to the FA0/0 port to reach computer D1 in LAN D. The data is then sent to D1. Alternatively, RouterA could have sent the data to RouterC through RouterB via Router A’s FA0/1 port. (Path selection for data packets is examined in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a> “Routing Protocols.”</p>
        <p class="noindent">Delivery of the information over the network is made possible by the use of an IP address and <a id="ch5key46" href="glossary.xhtml#glo524"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>routing tables</strong></span></a>. Routing tables keep track of the routes used for forwarding data to its destination. RouterA used its routing table to determine a network data path so computer A1’s data could reach computer D1 in LAN D. RouterA determines that a path to the network where computer D1 is located can be obtained via RouterA’s FA0/2 port to the FA0/2 port on RouterC. RouterC determines that computer D1 is on LAN D, which connects to RouterC’s FA0/0 port. RouterC issues an ARP request to determine the MAC address of computer D1. The MAC address is then used for final delivery of the data to computer D1.</p>

After RouterB receives the data packet from RouterA, it uses its routing tables to determine where to forward the data packet. RouterB determines that the data needs to be sent to RouterC, and it uses the FA0/3 port to forward the data.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The term <a id="ch5key47" href="glossary.xhtml#glo229"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>gateway</strong></span></a> is used to describe the address of the networking device that enables the hosts in a LAN to connect to networks and hosts outside the LAN. For example, for all hosts in LAN A, the gateway address is 10.10.10.250. This address is configured on the host computer. Any IP packets with a destination outside the LAN are sent to the gateway address. The gateway address is referred to as the <em>default gateway</em> in Windows OS and as the <em>router</em> in macOS.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec17">Network Segments</h4>
        <p class="noindent">A <em>network segment</em> is the networking link between two LANs. There is a segment associated with each connection of an internetworking device (for example, router–hub, router–switch, router–router). For example, the IP address for the network segment connecting LAN A to the router is 10.10.20.0. All hosts connected to this segment must contain a 10.10.20<em>.x</em> because the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 is being used. (Subnet masking is fully explained in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>, “<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">TCP/IP</a>.”)</p>
        <p class="noindent">Routers use the information about the network segments to determine where to forward data packets. For example, the network segments that connect to RouterA include the following:</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">10.10.20.0</p>
        <p class="uln-indent">10.10.200.0</p>

        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266"></span>The computers in LAN A are in the 10.10.20.0 network, which means every computer in this network must contain a 10.10.20.<em>x</em> IP address. For example, computer A1 in LAN A will have the assigned IP address 10.10.20.1 and gateway address 10.10.20.250. The computers in LAN B are located in the 10.10.10.0 network. This means that every computer in this network must contain a 10.10.10.<em>x</em> IP address. The <em>x</em> part of the IP address is assigned for each host. The gateway address for the hosts in LAN B is 10.10.10.250.</p>

        <p class="noindent">This section introduces well-known LAN architecture, data center architecture, and WAN technologies such as high-speed serial connections and Metro Optical Ethernet that are used to connect LANs or to connect the enterprise network to the outside world.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec20">Three-Tiered LAN Architecture</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Most enterprise networks use a three-tiered design that has core, distribution, and access layers (see <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig28">Figure 5-28</a>). These layers can be spread out into more layers or compacted into fewer, depending on the size of these networks. This three-tiered network structure is used in campus networks to improve data handling and routing within the network.</p>

        <aside class="hidden" id="Alch05fig28">
        <p>In the figure, the network structure consists of 3 layers, access, distribution, and core. The access layer consists of 4 LAN Connections LAN A, LAN B, LAN C, and LAN D. Two computers in each LAN are connected. The distribution layer consists of three routers: router A, router B, and router C. The core layer consists of two Switches A, and B. The LAN A in access layer is connected to switch A through Router A. LAN B, and LAN C are connected to switch A, and B respectively after passing through router 2. The LAN D in access layer is connected to switch B through Router C. The router A is connected to switch B, and router C is connected to switch A.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec21">Core</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The network core usually contains high-end layer 3 switches or routers. The core is the heart, or backbone, of the network. The major portion of a network’s data traffic passes through the core. The core must be able to quickly forward data to other parts of the network. Data congestion should be avoided at the core, if possible. This means that unnecessary route policies should be avoided. (An example of a route policy is <em>traffic filtering,</em> which limits what traffic can pass from one part of a network to another.) It takes time for a router to examine each data packet, and unnecessary route policies can slow down the network’s data traffic.</p>
        <p class="noindent">As mentioned earlier, high-end routers and layer 3 switches are typically selected for use in the core. Of the two, the layer 3 switch is the better choice. A layer 3 switch is essentially a router that uses electronic hardware instead of software to make routing decisions. The advantage of the layer 3 switch is the speed at which it can make a routing decision and establish a network connection.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another alternative for networking hardware in the core is a layer 2 switch. A layer 2 switch does not make any routing decisions and can quickly make network connection decisions based on the network hardware connected to its ports. The advantage of using a layer 2 switch in the core is cost. The disadvantage is that a layer 2 switch does not route data packets; however, high-speed layer 2 switches are more affordable than high-speed routers and layer 3 switches.</p>
        <p class="noindent">An important design issue in a campus network and the core is redundancy. <em>Redundancy</em> is a way to provide a backup route or network connection in the event of a link failure. The core hardware is typically interconnected to all distribution network hardware, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig28">Figure 5-28</a>. The objective is to ensure that data traffic continues for the entire network, even if a core networking device or link fails.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Each layer beyond the core breaks the network into smaller networks, with the final result being a group of networks that are capable of handling the amount of traffic generated. The design should thus incorporate some level of redundancy.</p>

        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec22"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_269"></span>Distribution/Aggregation Layer</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The distribution/aggregation layer in a network is the point where the individual LANs connect to the campus network routers or layer 3 switches. Routing and filtering policies are more easily implemented at the distribution layer without having a negative impact on the performance of the network data traffic. Also, the speed of the network data connections at the distribution layer is typically slower than at the core. For example, connection speeds at the core should be the highest possible, such as 1Gbps or 10Gbps, whereas the data speed connections at the distribution layer could be 100Mbps or 1Gbps. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig28">Figure 5-28</a> shows the connections to the access and core layers via the router’s Ethernet interfaces.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec23">Access/Edge Layer</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The access/edge layer is where the networking devices in a LAN connect together. The network hardware used in this layer is typically a layer 2 switch. Remember that a switch is a good choice because it forwards data packets directly to destination hosts connected to its ports, and network data traffic is not forwarded to all hosts in the network. The exception to this is with a broadcast, where data packets are sent to all hosts connected to the switch.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec24">Traffic Flow</h4>
        <p class="noindent">An important networking issue is how data traffic flows in the core, distribution, and access layers of a campus LAN. In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig28">Figure 5-28</a>, if computer A1 in LAN A sends data to computer D1 in LAN D, the data is first sent through the switch in LAN A and then to Router A in the distribution layer. Router A then forwards the data to one of the core switches, Switch A or Switch B. Switch A or Switch B then forwards the data to Router C. The data packet is then sent to the destination host in LAN D.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec25">Data Center Architecture</h4>
        <p class="noindent">In most networks, the data center is unique in its design architecture. Because the data center houses the critical enterprise servers and storage, with data constantly moving from server to server, it requires a design that can optimize these flows with great speed. Rather than using a three-tiered architecture, a data center network is likely to use a two-tiered architecture, such as the spine and leaf architecture.</p>
        <p class="noindent">At the leaf layer, each server rack has one or more access/edge switches, typically affixed at top-of-rack (ToR). The servers within the rack are connected and aggregate traffic from servers. The leaf layer is then connected to the spine layer, which is the backbone of the network and provides core switching functions. Each leaf switch connects to every spine switch in the network, creating multipath redundancy and load sharing performance.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Traditional data center traffic is from client to server and moves in and out of the data center; this is called north–south traffic. East–west traffic is the traffic flow from server to server or server to storage within the data center network. Today, we are seeing more and more east–west traffic due to the rise in popularity of virtualized and containerized systems in modern data centers. The spine and leaf architecture lends itself very well to this type of traffic flow as it reduces the number of hops between any devices in the data center network to only one.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec26"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_270"></span>WAN High-Speed Serial Connections</h4>
        <p class="noindent">The term <em>high-speed</em> is relative. For large networks, a high-speed connection could be a DS-3 line, which offers 44.7Mbps+, or a connection to a high-speed serial interface (<a id="ch5key48" href="glossary.xhtml#glo257"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>HSSI</strong></span></a>) that supports data rates from 300Kbps to 52Mbps. For small networks, a high-speed serial connection out of the network could be a T1 line (1.544Mbps). The T1 data rate is fast relative to the connection speed provided by a dial-up phone modem, so some users would call this a “high-speed” connection. This section provides an introduction to the data standards currently being used in data communications and the data formats being used. These data standards include T1 to T3, DS-1 to DS-3, E1, E3, and the <a id="ch5key49" href="glossary.xhtml#glo419"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>OC</strong></span></a> (optical carrier) data rates OC-1 to OC-192.</p>

The T1/DS-1 and T3/DS-3 designations are actually the same data rates, and the terms are used interchangeably. The Bell system T carriers were established in the 1960s primarily for transporting digitized telephone conversations. In the early 1980s, digital signal (<a id="ch5key51" href="glossary.xhtml#glo168"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>DS</strong></span></a>) subscriber lines became available. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05tab06">Table 5-6</a> lists the data rates for the T/DS carriers.

        <p class="noindent">A T1 line is capable of carrying 24 DS-0 transmissions, or 24 voice channels. Each DS-0 line uses 64Kbps (56Kbps) of data, but the data rate of 56Kbps in parentheses after 64Kbps indicates the rate actually available to the user in some cases. In other words, the DS-0 line does not guarantee that the full 64Kbps line is available. It depends on the connection provided by the telecommunications carrier (<a id="ch5key52" href="glossary.xhtml#glo616"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>telco</strong></span></a>—the local telephone company) and the equipment used to make the connection. When a 56Kbps connection is used, the additional part of the data is for the overhead (synchronization and framing) required for the digital transmission.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The data lines are leased from a telecommunications carrier for carrying any type of data, including voice, data, and video. It is important to note that when you lease a T1 (DS-1) line from a telecommunications carrier to provide a data connection from point A to point B, the telecommunications carrier does not provide you with your own point-to-point private physical connection. The telecommunications carrier provides you with sufficient data bandwidth and a switched connection in its system to carry your data traffic to the destination. You data is likely to be multiplexed with hundreds of other T1/DS-1 data channels. For example, in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig29">Figure 5-29</a>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_271"></span>networks A and B each have established and configured a T1 data connection to the <a id="ch5key53" href="glossary.xhtml#glo617"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>telco cloud</strong></span></a>—the switched network the telecommunications carrier uses to get the data to its destination.

        <p class="noindent">The type of network being configured and the equipment being used to make the direct connection determine what format is used for data encapsulation. For example, Cisco routers automatically configure the serial interfaces to run HDLC, but Cisco routers support many data encapsulation formats. HDLC data encapsulation formats are implemented differently by some vendors, and sometimes some equipment is not interoperable with other equipment, even if all the equipment has specified the HDLC encapsulation. In such a case, another encapsulation format, such as PPP, can be used to make a direct connection. Using incorrect encapsulation at either end will result in encapsulation errors and no connection.</p>

        <p class="noindent">The number of Internet users is growing at a staggering rate. One key factor that brings people to the Internet is its application. The systems have evolved greatly from the days of stand-alone applications running on computers to the days of real-time and collaborative applications that connect via the Internet. Many applications on the Internet are available for people to download and add to their computer systems. Coupled with the wealth of applications is the ever-increasing need for more bandwidth. It is no longer sufficient for some of these applications to run on lower-bandwidth modem connections. In a business environment, even T1 speed (1.544Mbps) is not adequate to accommodate the number of concurrent users and the increased data demands of many applications. As discussed in the previous sections, there have been many developments on both the commercial and residential sides (for example, fiber-to-the-business [FTTB]) to bring more bandwidth to consumers.</p>
        <p class="noindent">What every network infrastructure has in common is the Ethernet infrastructure. The design might be different, the equipment might be from different vendors, and the backbone speeds might not be the same; however, everyone is running the same Ethernet-based infrastructure. The IT world has invested a lot of time and money in improving Ethernet speeds. Ethernet has come a long way from the old 10BASE5 technology running over coaxial (coax) cable to the high-speed 10 Gigabit fiber-optic networks we have today. Ethernet is a standard network protocol used to connect virtually all networking devices. So, wouldn’t it be logical to extend the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_274"></span>Ethernet infrastructure beyond the internal network infrastructure? Why not use Ethernet as a WAN connection? <a id="ch5key60" href="glossary.xhtml#glo356"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Metro Optical Ethernet (MOE)</strong></span></a> was originally conceived to connect subscribers and businesses in metropolitan area networks (MANs). Metro Optical Ethernet has now evolved to <a id="ch5key61" href="glossary.xhtml#glo82"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>Carrier Ethernet</strong></span></a>, which covers much more than just a metropolitan area.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Much like a Frame Relay or ATM permanent virtual circuit (PVC), an EVC creates protection and data privacy for the subscriber sites on the same EVC and prevents data transfer between subscriber sites that are not part of the same EVC. From the EVC types, the MEF derived the following three Ethernet service types:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Ethernet line service (E-Line)</strong>—Point-to-point Ethernet service based on a point-to-point EVC</p></li>

        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Ethernet tree service (E-Tree)</strong>—Point-to-multipoint service based on a routed-multipoint EVC</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent">The <a id="ch5key66" href="glossary.xhtml#glo182"><span class="gray_kt"><strong>E-Line service type</strong></span></a> provides a point-to-point Ethernet virtual connection between two UNIs or subscriber sites, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig33">Figure 5-33</a>. It is analogous to a dedicated leased line or a Frame Relay PVC. This type of Carrier Ethernet service is the most popular one of all due to its simplicity. Internet service is usually provided using the E-Line service type.</p>

This type of service is more advantageous when adding new subscriber sites as they can be added to the same multipoint EVC without disturbing the existing subscriber sites on the same EVC. A transparent LAN service is a well-known service offered by the E-LAN service type. From the subscriber’s standpoint, it appears as though everyone is on the same LAN.</p>

        <h4 class="h4" id="ch5lev2sec31">Service Attributes</h4>
        <p class="noindent">Many service attributes define the capabilities of the previously mentioned Ethernet service types. These attributes are under constant revision by the MEF. This section details some of the attributes that are most pertinent to typical IT users.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The bandwidth profile service attribute is a commonly used attribute. As a matter of fact, the first thing a subscriber must do when ordering the Carrier Ethernet service is to choose the bandwidth. The bandwidth profile service attribute is either applied at the UNI or to an EVC to limit the rate at which the Ethernet frames can transverse the applied point. Even though the UNI might be delivered as a 1Gbps physical connection, the subscriber might choose to subscribe to only 500Mbps worth of bandwidth. Traffic rate limiting is needed in such situations. The bandwidth profile service attribute uses the following parameters to for traffic rate limiting:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Committed information rate (CIR):</strong> This is the same parameter used in Frame Relay. It is an average rate measured in bits per second that is used to guarantee the bandwidth the network must deliver.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Committed burst size (CBS):</strong> This is the traffic size, in kilobytes, that is allowed to burst and is not discarded or shaped by the profile.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Excess information rate (EIR):</strong> This is an average rate parameter, in bits per second, that is used to allow traffic greater than the CIR to traverse and may deliver it when the network is not congested.</p></li>
        <li><p class="bullet"><strong>Excess burst size (EBS):</strong> This is the burstable size allowed when the traffic is in the EIR mode.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_277"></span>Another useful service attribute is VLAN tag preservations. In a typical campus infrastructure, VLANs are used to separate physical segments into many logical segments. These VLANs reside locally. When connecting multiple campuses across the WAN, the VLANs cannot be extended; the separation has to be done at the higher OSI layer. It is typically carried out as different routed networks. With a Carrier Ethernet network, LAN extension is no longer an issue. The VLAN tag preservations service attribute can be used to carry out the mission. With this attribute, all Ethernet frames received from a subscriber traverse untouched across the EVC. Therefore, when an 802.1Q VLAN tag is provisioned and applied at the customer equipment (CE), its customer edge VLAN ID (CE-VLAN ID) is preserved.</p>
