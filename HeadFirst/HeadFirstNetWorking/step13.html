It’s called a stack because it’s usually represented in a vertical stack of protocols. We covered several of these protocols, but we didn’t put them in the context of the TCP/IP stack.</p><p>Many books start off by introducing the TCP/IP stack, but we chose to be different. The reason we did not present this is that there is no absolute model for TCP/IP, and we see this as a problem.</p><p>The model below is based on RFC 1122, but you’ll see many models that are slightly different.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The application layer is where TCP/IP applications work.</strong></span> This includes ftp, smtp, telnet, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The transport layer is where TCP works.</strong></span> This is to guarantee communications between two network nodes by providing error checking.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The Internet layer is the IP addressing layer.</strong></span> This is how nodes find each other.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>This is the layer that connects the software to the hardware.</strong></span> This is often called the media-access layer.</p></li></ul></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00511a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00511"></a><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780596804398/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1567096.png" alt="image with no caption" width="178" height="172"></div></div><p>If you look back at <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Packet Analysis: You’ve Been Framed">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>, you will see how an Ethernet frame is built from all these parts. The Link layer corresponds to the frame parts; the Internet layer corresponds to the IP part of the frame; the TCP part of a packet corresponds to the TCP part of the frame. Not every TCP/IP packet type includes all the layers. Frames holding ICMP packets will only have the bottom two layers. This is just a way of viewing how the various parts of the TCP/IP protocol work together. It also gives guidelines to developers on how to write network applications and drivers that use TCP/IP.</p><p>For more information, take a look at <span class="strong"><strong><code class="literal">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122</code></strong></span></p></div><div class="sect1" title="#5 VLANS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hash5_vlans"></a>#5 VLANS</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1090" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1328" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1351" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1742" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1806" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1851" class="indexterm"></a>Another hot topic that we didn’t cover is VLANs. This stands for <span class="bolditalic">Virtual Local Area Networks</span>. It’s a way for switches to form virtual networks. Specifically, the broadcast domain gets spread across multiple switches. This allows a network administrator to virtually separate hosts on the network as if they were on separate physical networks. A router is needed to move traffic between VLANs.</p><p>A network administrator would want to separate traffic for security and performance reasons. For security, you might want to keep certain servers from being accessed from certain parts of your network. As an example, a college might not want computers that students use to have access to administrative servers. A VLAN would allow those servers to be spread around campus, but wouldn’t allow the student computers to see the traffic coming and going to those administrative servers. Splitting up the broadcast domains would reduce the amount of broadcast traffic on a given VLAN port.</p><p>VLANS are implemented by creating VLANs, and attaching ports to these VLANs. The packets created by hosts on VLANs are tagged by the switch that has VLANs setup. That way, other switches know which VLAN ports to send those packets out to.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="#6 Cisco IOS Simulators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hash6_cisco_ios_simulators"></a>#6 Cisco IOS Simulators</h1></div></div></div><p>We know that not everyone has a Cisco or other brand of router sitting on their desk.

This is the routing protocol used by ISPs. It is unique in that it uses ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) to route traffic instead of IP network addresses. The ASNs used by BGP are actually registered with one of the Internet registries such as arin.net.</p><p>Blocks of IP addresses are aggregated under an ASN. This aggregation of IP network addresses enables routers using BPG to hold the entire ASN route table of the Internet. In other words, if you get to the big leagues and manage a router using BGP, that router will have a route table of the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire Internet</em></span>. Right now that table is about 200+ MBs.</p><p>BPG does not do automatic discovery of neighbors. You have to enter these neighbors yourself, and those neighbors have to setup your router as a neighbor as well. Also, encryption is generally used to exchange BGP routes. Entities that have multiple Internet connections and/or large blocks of IP network addresses are likely to be using BGP.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="#8 VPN"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hash8_vpn"></a>#8 VPN</h1></div></div></div><p>Say you want to work from home on some sensitive company information. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just hook up to your companies network to do that work? Well, VPNs allow you to do that. VPN stands for <span class="bolditalic">Virtual Private Network</span>. It has two parts, a special network configuration on the client computer and a VPN gateway on the network that you wish to connect into. A VPN allows a remotely located client to gain secure access to an internal network. The communication between a VPN client and gateway is encrypted to protect the communications.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00512a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00512"></a><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780596804398/files/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1567098.png" alt="image with no caption" width="680" height="178"></div></div><p>VPN works by encrypting the packets destined for the internal network. It then puts those encrypted packets into the data section of a regular TCP packet, sends that packet across the public network, and then the VPN gateway removes the encrypted packet, decodes it and sends it into the internal network.</p><p>There are also VPN Gateway to VPN Gateway connections which allow a small office to have internal network access to a parent company’s network using a VPN gateway.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="#9 Intrusion Detection Systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hash9_intrusion_detection_systems"></a>#9 Intrusion Detection Systems</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1083" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1306" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1815" class="indexterm"></a>With all the problems of people trying to get into your systems, wouldn’t it be nice to be able to detect this type and activity and have it reported to you or, even better, take some kind of action?</p><p>Well, IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) do just this. These are generally special purpose servers that have the proper software to listen on your network for anomalous traffic. This could include scanning behavior, incorrect data on registered ports, or even denial-of-service attacks.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="app01note02"></a>Note</h3><p>Although many firewalls incorporate IDS functions as well.</p></div><p>A popular open source package is <span class="bolditalic">snort</span>. Snort is similar to wireshark in that it can sniff network traffic. The difference is that it filters this traffic using various rules to look for this anomalous traffic using different patterns. There are many rules developed by network administrator in order to capture this bad traffic.</p><p>Some IDSs also allow actions to take place based on this kind of traffic. This action usually consists of implementing access lists on a router or firewall which block ports and/or IP addresses of the hosts creating the anomalous network traffic.</p><p>IDSs are great to have, but like anything, you can’t just set it up and let it run. You have to actively manage and monitor it for it to be at its most effective on your network.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="#10 Cisco Certification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hash10_cisco_certification"></a>#10 Cisco Certification</h1></div></div></div><p>The last big thing we didn’t cover was network certifications. The biggest in terms of people with these certifications are the Cisco certifications. There are two main ones, CCNA and CCNP, with CCNA being the entry level network certification. Both of these certifications are obtained by taking one or more tests. In the case of the CCNP, there are three or four tests to take (two of the tests can be taken as a combined test).</p><p>The CCNA requires that you know a little more information than this book provides. The CCNP requires the same type of knowledge but in much greater depth. It also requires a lot more knowledge of switched networking and wide area networking using various telco technologies such as ISDN and T-1 lines.</p><p>There are other vendor specific certifications, but these two are the heavy hitters in the network cert world.</p></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780596804398/files/core.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
