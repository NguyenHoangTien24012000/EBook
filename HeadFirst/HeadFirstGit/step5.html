The repositories we used are ones that we initialized locally using the <code>git init</code> command. Despite that, we’ve managed to get a lot done—we created branches, merged them, and used Git utilities like the <code>git log</code> and <code>git diff</code> commands to see how our repository evolved over time. But most projects aren’t like that. We often work in teams or with friends or colleagues. Git offers a very powerful collaboration model—one in which we can all share our work using a single repository. It all starts by making our repository “publicly available,” which makes the commit history of the project a “shared” history. In a public repository we can do everything we’ve learned so far, just as we’ve always done (with a few exceptions). We can create branches and commits and add to the commit history, and so can others; everyone can see and add to that history. That’s how we collaborate with Git.</p>
        <p><strong>But before we start collaborating</strong>, let’s spend some time together to understand how public repositories work and how to get started with them. Go team!</p>

        <p>How would such a situation come about? Imagine your friend is working on an open source project and asks for your help. They can create a Git repository and share it with you. Now the two of you can work on it together.</p>
        <p>Think of the millions of open source projects out there (some of which you’ve probably used!). Most, if not all, rely on the work of dozens of collaborators. You might decide to help out one such project by fixing a bug or adding a much-needed feature. But to do that, you’re going to need the code. How can you get it?</p>

        <p>You’ll use another Git command: <code>clone</code>. As the name suggests, the <code>git clone</code> command allows you to create a copy (a “clone”) of an existing repository. The clone command expects to get a special URL as its argument:</p>

So what does “elsewhere” mean? That would be any other computer that you can access—that is, a computer that you can connect to over a network, like the internet, and that you have permissions to clone repositories from.</p>
        <p>Where can you host Git repositories? There are plenty of options. You <em>could</em> set up a personal server, but that’s a lot of work: you’d have to find a place to run it and learn about Git administration. The easiest option is to use a service that allows you to host a Git repository with minimal fuss. (Yes, we are all about that!)</p>
        <p>Perhaps you’ve heard of GitHub, owned by Microsoft. Or GitLab. Or Bitbucket, owned by Atlassian. All of these services allow you to host repositories and make it easy to get started. All you need is a login. For the purposes of this book, we decided to show you GitHub—but for the most part, everything you learn about GitHub will work with similar sites out there, albeit with minor variations. GitHub offers a generous free plan for personal projects, so you won’t need to worry about pricing.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">We mentioned that you are going to need a GitHub login in the book introduction. If you haven’t done so, head back there and follow the instructions. We’ll wait right here.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Q: My company uses GitHub as a collaboration tool, so I already have a login. Do I need to create another login?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> We are big fans of separating business from pleasure. (Go ahead, admit it—reading this book has been a real pleasure!) If you’re using your company email to log into GitHub, we suggest you create an account with your personal email address.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I would rather run my own server than use a third-party service. Change my mind.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Hosting a Git repository isn’t just about setting up a server! You’ll also need to set up a way to serve up the Git repository over the network, potentially protect it behind an authentication mechanism, and manage the server over its lifetime. It’s a commitment!</p>
        <p>Our objective in picking GitHub is just to show you how to use Git as a collaboration tool, so we are going to keep it simple. One thing at a time, right?</p>

Head to this URL in your browser: <em><a href="https://github.com/looselytyped/working-with-remotes">https://github.com/looselytyped/working-with-remotes</a></em>. At the top right-hand corner, you should see a “Fork” button.</p>

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>When you click that button, GitHub will prompt you to log in, if you haven’t already. It will then copy the repository we set up under <em>your account</em> in GitHub.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Pay close attention to the address bar in your browser after this completes.

        </div>
        <p>So what just happened? The repository <em>we</em> created is under our account, which means that while <em>you</em> can see it, you can’t modify it. <em>Forking</em> is a <strong>GitHub feature</strong> that makes it easy to copy our repository (or any other publicly available repository) to your account.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Not to beat a dead horse, but there is no such feature as “forking” in Git itself. Forking is a feature GitHub offers to make it easier to collaborate.</span></p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="repositories" data-secondary="working-with-remotes" id="idm45426360828224"></a><strong>We can empathize.</strong> We will start by saying that forking isn’t a Git feature: it is a <em>GitHub</em> feature. So why did we just make you do the last exercise? This book is about Git, not GitHub, right?</p>
        <p>Think about how you’ve worked the exercises for <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#beginning_gitcolon_get_going_with_git">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> to <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#undoingcolon_fixing_your_mistakes">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>: you downloaded a zip file with all of the exercises. That is, you got a <em>copy</em> of the exercises we created for you, available locally on your hard drive. This allowed you to play with them to your heart’s delight.</p>
        <p>For this chapter, we’ve done something a little different. We created a Git repository for you—it’s called <code>working-with-remotes.</code> We uploaded it to GitHub, but it lives under <em>our</em> account. In order to modify our repository (or any other repository you don’t own), the owner would need to give you explicit permissions to do so. In GitHub, this means you would have to send us your GitHub login so we could add you as a “collaborator” on our repository.</p>
        <p>Now, as much as we love you (and you know we do), we are hoping that we will have thousands of readers. Not only would adding each and every one of you become tedious, but you would all end up stepping on each other’s toes as you made changes.</p>
        <p>Forking a repository simply gives you your <em>own copy</em> of that repository, under your own account, so you can play with it, again, to your heart’s delight. It’s a lot like how you downloaded our repository for the other chapters, except this time you’re downloading to your GitHub account instead of your hard drive.</p>
        <p>So how do you get it onto your hard drive? You <em>clone</em> it.</p>
        <aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="there_are_no_dumb_questions-id00155">
        <h5>there are no Dumb Questions</h5>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I clone a repository without forking? If so, what does that mean?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. You could visit <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> right now, peruse any one of the millions of repositories available, and clone any one of them.</p>
        <p>However, if you wanted to collaborate on that project, you’d have to ask the owner of that repository for permissions. Throughout this chapter you are going to be making changes to the <code>working-with-remotes</code> repository. By forking it, you get a copy of our repository under your account in GitHub, and you can do with that whatever you like without us granting any additional permissions. Certainly makes things easier all around.</p>

Is this a usual workflow?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> That depends. For a project at work, you will most likely be made a collaborator on that project, which automatically gives you permissions to modify the repository. This means you wouldn’t have to fork the repository—you could simply clone it and start collaborating with your colleagues.</p>
        <p>However, if you want to play around with or contribute to an open source project, you’ll most likely need to fork the project. This makes it easier for the people managing the open source project, because they don’t have to explicitly add you as a collaborator.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: You pointed out that the</strong> <code>git clone</code> <strong>command, by default, creates a folder with the same name as the repository I’m cloning. What if I want to change the name? Can I do that?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Sure! That’s just the default behavior. The name of the folder Git creates really has nothing to do with the clone operation. To change the name of the folder, you can supply the name you want as a second argument to the clone command:</p>
        <p><code>git clone &lt;url&gt; name-of-folder-to-be-created</code></p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can rename the folder after cloning—it’s just the name of the directory. All the information Git needs is safely tucked inside the hidden <code>.git</code> folder. However, we usually prefer to keep the name of the directory the same as the repository we are cloning, unless it collides with something we already have, like an existing folder with the same name that happens to be in the same directory.</p>

        <p>You’ve probably noticed that our remote URL starts with <code>https</code>, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. Git supports various other protocols to communicate with the server, like SSH, which stands for Secure Shell. However, SSH is a bit involved since it requires you to set up your public and private SSH keys, and upload keys to GitHub. If you haven’t worked with SSH before, be sure to look up GitHub’s documentation on how you can use it.</p>

And much like any repository you’ve worked with so far, the repository you clone consists of commits, branches, <code>HEAD</code>, commit history, and anything else a repository can have in it.</p>
        <p>When you clone such a repository, Git does a few things:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Git first creates a folder in the directory where you ran the <code>git clone</code> command; the folder will have the same name as the repository you are cloning (unless you specify a different name). Inside that, it creates a <code>.git</code> folder.</p></li>
        <li><p>It then copies the entire commit graph, including all commits, branches, and a few other things, from the repository you are cloning into the <code>.git</code> folder it just created.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, it uses the <code>git switch</code> branch to check out the same branch that was checked out in the original (the one you are cloning from).</p>

You can make any number of changes to your local copy, and the remote would be completely unaware of those changes.</p>
        <p>Think about it this way—suppose you create a funny meme using one of the many meme generator sites online and share it on your favorite social media site. You probably don’t know how many people see it (hopefully more than a few), but everyone who sees it knows it came from you. In this scenario, you are the “remote”—lots of folks saw (“cloned”) your meme and they know it came from you.</p>
        <p>When you clone a repository, the remote repository does not know you cloned it. However, your local copy knows about the remote repository that it “originated” from. This is how clones differ from the other repositories you’ve created so far in this book, in that your local repositories don’t have a “remote” counterpart. (More about this in a bit.)</p>
        <p>Let’s take the analogy a bit further—your friends might decide to share your funny meme to their followers. Those followers will consider your friends the “origin” of that meme, right?</p>
        <p>Similarly, you could share your fork, or even your local repository, with other users, and the repositories cloned from your copy would treat your copy as <em>their</em> remote.</p>
        <p>All this stems from a particular characteristic of Git: it’s a distributed version control system.</p>
        </div></section>
        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Git is distributed"><div class="sect1" id="git_is_distributed">

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cloned repositories" data-secondary="advantages" id="idm45426363656896"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="repositories" data-secondary="cloned" id="idm45426360659664"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="repositories" data-secondary="cloned" data-tertiary="advantages" id="idm45426360659024"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="repositories" data-secondary="distributed version control systems" id="idm45426360657808"></a>Git belongs to a family of version control systems that are referred to as “distributed.” In a distributed system, everyone who clones a repository gets a full copy of the repository. Every commit, every branch—we mean <em>everything</em>. So, if you have a full copy of the original, what differentiates your copy from the original?</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">If you’ve ever used or heard of Subversion or CVS—these are examples of centralized version control systems.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>Others who can access your copy can now treat it as the original, or “source of truth.” In other words, everyone who clones a repository is equal. The first benefit of this is that if something were to happen to the original remote, everyone could switch to using another clone as their remote and continue working.</p>

        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>There is another huge benefit to this model: your local copy is completely disconnected from the remote. You can perform pretty much any operation—branch, commit, merge, view the commit history using the <code>git log</code> command, and see differences using the <code>git diff</code> command—all of it locally, without the remote knowing about it. There is <strong>no server communication</strong> going on while you get your work done locally. This means you can still work even if you aren’t connected to the internet (like on a plane).</p>

        <p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GitHub" data-secondary="advantages" id="idm45426360889920"></a><strong>Q: Git is distributed. I get that. So why use a service like GitHub or GitLab?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> First and foremost, GitHub keeps things easy. It offers a very convenient way to host a Git repository, with facilities like authentication built in. These services make operationalizing a Git server easy.</p>
        <p>They also offer high availability. If you were to host a Git repository on, say, your laptop, it might be unavailable if you turned off your computer on vacation, or if your machine has a catastrophic failure.</p>
        <p>What’s more, these services are easy to find (you just navigate to <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a> or <a href="http://GitLab.com">GitLab.com</a> using your browser) and easy to access (you just need to have a login). They also make it easy for the repository owner to add collaborators, using their email or login ID.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you are going to collaborate with your colleagues on projects, you all need to decide what the “source of truth” is going to be: the place where everyone’s work comes together. All these benefits make picking a service like GitHub an easy choice.</p>
        <p>All that said, there isn’t anything stopping you from running your own hosting solution. Everything we discuss in this book will work no matter which route you take.</p>

        <p>The answer lies in a Git command called <code>git push.</code> It allows you to take any new commits that you’ve created in your local repository, and push them to the remote. In other words, the <code>git push</code> command allows you to synchronize your local changes with the remote.</p>

        <p>It’s easier to think of a remote repository as just another copy of your commit history, with the caveat that any changes you make to your local copy <em>eventually</em> need to be synchronized with the remote. The push command allows you to do just that.</p>

        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Just to be clear, you’ll need to have connectivity to the remote for this to work. You can’t perform a push while being disconnected.</span></p>

So far, your <code>working-with-remotes</code> repository has only one branch, which showed up when you cloned the repository the first time around. Now, when you push, Git will attempt to update the <code>master</code> branch in the remote with any changes that you’ve made to your local <code>master</code> branch. That is, Git will update the remote <code>master</code> branch to look like your local <code>master</code> branch.</p>
        <p>But what if you’ve created a new branch in the meantime? If you decided to push the changes in the new branch, where would those changes go? To the <code>master</code> branch? Should Git create a new branch in the remote with the same name as the local branch, and then update it to reflect your local changes? Or should it just error out?</p>
        <p>For now, we are going to keep it simple and just tell Git to error out if it doesn’t know what to do. Once you get more comfortable with Git and working with remotes, you can choose a different behavior for Git.</p>
        <p>We’ll make these configuration changes in much the same way you made changes to Git in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#beginning_gitcolon_get_going_with_git">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>.

        <p>The “simple” push configuration is often referred to as the “seat belt” option, in that it’s the safest choice of all the options that Git allows when it comes to configuring how <code>git push</code> will behave (there are four other options, in case you’re curious).</p>
        <p>Also, Git defaults to the simple push configuration for new installations. So why did we make you do this exercise? Well, first, we wanted to show you how to do it.

That way, if someone were to clone that repository, they would clone everything, including the commits you just made and pushed to the remote. So how do you go about doing that? We’ve already spoken of the <code>git push</code> command, so let’s see it in practice.</p>
        <p>Let’s say you’ve just made a commit on the <code>master</code> branch and you want to push it up to the remote. You would use the <code>git push</code> command. However, since GitHub needs to make sure you have the right access to write (there’s a mouthful, huh?) to the repository, it will prompt you to log in:</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
        <img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492092506/files/assets/f0230-02.png" alt="Image" width="600" height="366">
        <h6></h6>
        </div></figure>
        <p>As you can see, GitHub prompts for the username and password here. Be sure to use your own username here. It is a tad confusing because although it says “password,” what it’s really asking for is your “personal access token.” We told you how to set this up in the introduction of this book, but if you’ve somehow misplaced your token, you can always generate another one using the “Personal access tokens” panel under your profile in GitHub. Also, when you enter your token, you don’t actually see what you type (for security reasons), which <em>can</em> be a little unnerving. Be sure to get it right!</p>
        <p>Git then does a bunch of work to send your commits to the remote, and if all goes well, you won’t see any errors. That’s a good sign. But can you confirm if it <em>really</em> worked? Let’s find out.</p>

So how do you know if it worked?</p>
        <p>For starters, if Git does not report an error in the console, then you know all went well. Another way to check is to take a look at the remote, which in this case is GitHub.</p>

        <p>GitHub displays a wealth of information about your repository, including a drop-down menu that lists all the branches that GitHub knows about, as well as the commit ID of the latest commit on each branch. You can also click on each of the files and see the contents as they were committed.</p>
        <p>This is kinda nice, because you can use GitHub’s interface to navigate your repository just like you would using your terminal and your favorite text editor: you can “switch” branches, click on files to see their contents—all that good stuff.</p>

        <h5>there are no Dumb Questions</h5>
        <p><strong>Q: Why doesn’t Git automatically update the remote when I commit?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> There are several reasons for this. First, Git is very deliberate in the choices it makes; if there is any doubt, it defers to you. We saw in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> that when a merge results in a conflict, Git simply throws up its hands and asks you to resolve it. We also know that pushing changes updates the remote. So, once again, Git will just sit back and wait for you to explicitly tell it to update the remote repository by doing a <code>git push</code>.</p>
        <p>The second possible reason is that you might not be online. If Git attempts to push changes while you’re, say, on a plane with no connectivity, the push would fail. Once again, Git defers to you to decide when to push.</p>
        <p>Another reason is that Git allows you to undo typos in commit messages by amending them and to reset commits with the <code>git reset</code> command (we spoke of both of these in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#undoingcolon_fixing_your_mistakes">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>). So it waits till you are absolutely sure you’re good and ready to go.</p>
        <p>Also, your repository doesn’t always have a remote! Up until now in this book, you have worked with standalone repositories created locally on your machine. For those kinds of repositories, it doesn’t even make sense to push, does it?</p>
        <p>Finally, Git encourages experimenting with branches. You might have created a branch to play with an idea or approach, and maybe you aren’t ready to share that with the world. Git separates the act of making a commit from pushing those commits to a remote, thus allowing you to choose when and how that happens. You’re the boss!</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What happens if I push a branch that I’ve already pushed?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> No worries. If you push a branch and then push it again, Git will simply respond with an <code>Everything up-to-date</code> message. No harm done.</p>

You know that Git is transporting your commit history back and forth, while keeping the commit IDs the <em>same</em>! This has pretty big implications, which we’ll be talking more about soon.</p>
        <p>The thing is, when you are working locally, Git does not care whether you create a commit yourself or get it as part of a repository you clone. Any and all commits in your commit history are the same, as far as Git is concerned.</p>
        <p>Why does this matter? You already know that there are some Git operations that can change commit IDs (remember amending commit messages?) and modify commit histories (the <code>git reset</code> command). So what does this mean when working with remote repositories? Glad you asked—we gotta cover a bit of ground before we get there, but keep this in the back of your mind as you proceed through the rest of this book.</p>

But how does Git know where to push? We mentioned earlier that when you clone a repository, the clone knows the location of the remote repository. If you’re ever curious about the remote repository’s location, you can ask Git with the <code>remote</code> command:</p>

        <p>Bit of a letdown, huh? The <code>git remote</code> command, by default, lists the “alias” that Git gives the remote, which, by default, is “origin.” (This is just a label—you can change the name if you prefer.) To get a little more information, you can ask the <code>git remote</code> command to be more <em>verbose</em> with the <code>-v</code> (or <code>--verbose</code>) flag.</p>
        <figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

        </div></figure>
        <p>This looks a lot better. The <code>git remote</code> command in verbose mode provides more information. The second line is of particular interest—this is how Git knows what to do when you perform a <code>git push</code>. It looks at the URL next to the <code>origin</code> remote and sends over your changes to that location.</p>
        <p>When you invoke the <code>git push</code> command, Git is actually performing <code>git push origin</code>. This, in turn, pushes your changes to the URL listed in the “push” entry when you run the <code>git remote</code> command.</p>

You can also initialize a repository by cloning an <em>existing</em> repository using the <code>git clone</code> command.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <code>git clone</code> command takes a URL as its argument, which it obtains from the original repository.</p></li>
        <li><p>To make a repository shareable, you can use a Git repository manager. There are several available, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.</p></li>
        <li><p>When you clone an existing repository:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Git creates a folder that houses the repository on your machine and, by default, has the same name as the repository you are cloning.</p></li>
        <li><p>Git then pulls the entire commit history of the original repository into the newly created folder, including all the branches.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, Git switches to the “default” branch in the repository. This makes all the files in the default branch available to you in your working directory.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>We refer to the original repository as the “remote” and the local copy as the “clone.”</p></li>
        <li><p>The remote and the clone are completely disconnected.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can work in the clone like you would in any other repository—you can commit, create new branches, you name it—because Git is a distributed version control system.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a distributed version control system, there is no <em>original</em> copy, since every clone has everything the origin does. If the original copy were to go away, you could treat any clone as the source of truth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Because the remote is completely independent of the clone, work you do on the clone will not be automatically reflected in the remote.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you create new commits on a branch that the <strong>clone knows about</strong> and you want to synchronize the commit histories of the remote and the clone, you have to explicitly tell Git to do so.</p></li>
        <li><p>In order to push new commits on a branch that exists on both the clone and the remote, you have to use the <code>git push</code> command.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can verify if your push has worked by visiting the location where the remote exists. Git repository managers like GitHub will list all of the branches and the individual commits on each branch.</p></li>
        <li><p>Git knows where to push because the clone records the URL of the remote.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can use the <code>git remote</code> command in a clone to see details about the remote.</p></li>
        <li><p>When you clone a repository, Git names the remote “origin” by default.</p></li>

(Well, OK, you first forked, then cloned.) That pulled down a preexisting commit history that we prepared for you, in that we created and authored those commits. You then proceeded to make a new commit, which you added to the commit history of the <code>master</code> branch. For this new commit, though, <em>you</em> are the creator and author. Just remember, as far as Git is concerned, there is no difference between our commits and yours.</p>
        <p>However, there is one semantic difference between the commit you created locally and the one you pushed. The local commit is private—only you know it exists, and you can do with it whatever you desire. You could choose to amend the commit message, which (as you might recall from <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#undoingcolon_fixing_your_mistakes">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>) would change the commit ID. You could use <code>git reset HEAD~1</code> and undo the commit. You could decide not to push the commit at all, leaving it on your local <code>master</code> branch copy forever. But you pushed.</p>
        <p>So what happens when you push? Git attempts to reconcile what you have locally with what’s out there on the remote. In your case, it sees the new commit on the <code>master</code> branch and adds it to the remote’s <code>master</code> branch (because that’s the only change).</p>

        <h1>Standard operating procedure: branches</h1>
        <p>It doesn’t really matter whether you create your Git repository locally using the <code>git init</code> command or by cloning it using the <code>git clone</code> command. Git repositories are Git repositories, and everything you have learned so far in this book applies—including how to work with branches. You learned about the workflow we recommended in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>: you always work in a branch, and when you’re done, you merge that branch <em>into</em> an integration branch.</p>
        <p>Similarly, for a cloned repository, you (and perhaps your team) decide which branch will play the role of integration branch, where everyone’s work comes together.</p>
        <p>This means that anytime you want to do some work, you should create a branch from the integration branch. Remember, the remote is completely unaware of the work you are doing. You can create a branch, add commits, rename branches, even delete them: as far as the remote is concerned, none of this matters. Just like the commits you prepare are private, so are the branches you create locally.</p>
        <p>You already know one way to incorporate your changes into an integration branch—you simply merge your branch into it. But now that you have a remote, what does that mean for integrating your changes? Is it different, and if so, how? So let’s start there. (We have a surprise waiting for you at the end of that discussion. Stay tuned!)</p>

        <p>In the previous exercise, you created a new branch called <code>feat-a</code> and committed a new file. You then switched back to the <code>master</code> branch, introduced another file, and committed that as well.</p>
        <p>Now flex your brain: if you were to merge the feat-a branch into the <code>master</code> branch, would that be a fast-forward merge? Or would Git create a merge commit?</p>

So what do I do with my feature branch now?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Delete it! Your work has been incorporated into the integration branch, so there is no reason to hold onto the feature branch.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What if I forget to push the</strong> <code><strong>master</strong></code> <strong>branch to the remote after merging my integration branch?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> To be honest, this is probably the most common mistake newcomers make when working with remotes (though, let’s be honest, even experienced users like us forget to push on occasion).</p>
        <p>This takes us back to Git’s distributed nature. Remember, the remote is completely unaware of your branching and merging efforts. If you decide not to (or worse, forget to) push the <code>master</code> branch back upstream to the remote, the remote will never know.</p>
        <p>If you intend to push a branch, just do it as soon as you finish merging. Later, if you aren’t sure, you can always push again. Git will do what it does best—send your commits up to the remote. Remember, though: if you push a branch twice in a row and nothing has changed, Git simply responds with <code>Everything up-to-date</code> and does nothing.</p>

The workflow we recommend involves creating feature branches for any and all work, then merging back into integration branches when you are done.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons you might want to push a feature branch up to the remote. For example, you might want a remote backup of your work, in case something were to happen to your workstation.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you’d like a colleague or a friend to look at your changes. If your branch is available in GitHub (or any other Git repository manager), they can look over your changes using their browser. (We will be diving into collaborating over Git and GitHub in the next chapter.)</p>
        <p>Remember that surprise we mentioned earlier when we spoke about integrating your changes? Here it is—you can use repository managers like GitHub to perform merges!</p>
        <p>We’re getting carried away. Let’s get your question answered—how do we push local feature branches to the remote?</p>

When you cloned this repository at the beginning of this chapter, the <code>master</code> branch, both of those commits came along for the ride. Since the remote already knew about <code>master</code>, Git allowed you to push back to that branch using the <code>git push</code> command. Git knows there is a <code>master</code> in the remote, so it syncs up the remote <code>master</code> branch with any commits that appeared in your local <code>master</code> branch.</p>
        <p>But if you’ve just created a new feature branch locally (like the one you created in the last exercise), the remote doesn’t know about it. What happens if you push it?</p>

        </div></figure>
        <p>Well, that certainly didn’t go as planned. What happened?</p>
        <p>When you attempt to push a branch to the remote, Git tries to figure out exactly which remote branch it should update. But if the branch is brand new, Git won’t see a counterpart in the remote. It doesn’t know what to do, so it simply throws up its hands and asks! You need to explicitly tell Git the name of the branch in the remote it should update with the commits in your clone. Following Git’s advice makes it all work:</p>

        <p>You might be wondering why you need to specify the name of the remote (<code>origin</code>) when you set the upstream destination for a branch. Git already knows about the remote, right? So why do we have to explicitly specify it?</p>
        <p>Because Git allows your local repository to talk to multiple remotes. You might clone one repository but decide to push your changes to another.</p>
        <p>Why? Well, that’s a discussion for another book. For now, just know that when you set the upstream for a branch, you need to tell it <em>which</em> remote to push to. For us, that will always be “origin.”</p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> The terms <em>upstream</em> and <em>downstream</em>, while commonly used, are a bit confusing when you’re working with a distributed system like Git. When we clone a repository and it gets data and puts it onto our local machine, the local is <em>downstream</em>.</p>
        <p>When we push, or send data from the local to the remote, the remote is <em>upstream</em> from us. And yes, in our case, setting upstream is the same as setting the remote.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Do I have to set the upstream every time I push a local branch?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Once you set the upstream for a local branch, you never have to do it again <em>for that branch</em>.</p>
        <p>However, if you create <em>another</em> local branch and you want to push it, you <em>will</em> have to set the upstream for that branch.</p>

Done!</p>
        <p>But there is another way. Repository managers like GitHub offer much more than simply housing Git repositories. You’ve already seen how you can navigate files using your browser, list the branches you’ve pushed to the remote, and view all the commits for each of those branches.</p>
        <p>But GitHub and other repository managers also allow you to manage your Git repository using your browser, including performing merges! This comes with a surprisingly useful feature called <em>pull requests</em>. If your team or company has chosen to collaborate using GitHub, chances are you’ll use pull requests for merging. Let’s get you prepared to hit the ground running!</p>

Consider this—suppose you’re working with several colleagues, sharing the same Git repository, which you’ve chosen to host on GitHub (like we did). Your repository’s integration branch is <code>master.</code> You are all working independently of one another, in your own clones and your own feature branches.</p>
        <p>When you’re done, you want to merge your work back into <code>master</code>. Now, remember, your colleagues are doing the exact same thing—creating branches based on the integration branch before they start their work. In other words, when you incorporate your work into an integration branch, your changes affect everybody else working on the same repository! With lots of people, this can get tricky.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">We covered this workflow at the end of <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>. Feel free to flip back to it and refresh your memory if you need to.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>So instead of merging your local branch directly into <code>master</code>, you push the branch to the remote and create a pull request. This tells your colleagues that you wish to merge some work and displays the commits and the files changed, so they know what changes you’ve made. The pull request also gives your colleagues a way to make suggestions on how you could change or improve your work. Once they approve your pull request, you can go ahead and merge your changes. You’re done!</p>
        <p>You could think about pull requests as “merging in public”—your colleagues get a chance to review your work before it becomes part of the whole.</p>

What do I gain from making a pull request? Does it make sense for me to use them?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Good point. Pull (or merge) requests are really useful when you have more than one collaborator on a project. You can get their input on your changes and notify them that you’re getting ready to merge your code.</p>
        <p>To be completely honest, for solo projects, we prefer to just merge into our integration branch locally and push the integration branch to the remote. We believe that practice makes perfect, though, so you should practice issuing pull requests a few times just to get the hang of it.</p>
        <p>When we’re working on teams, it’s a different story: we use pull requests. We are huge fans of collaboration and clear communication, and pull requests are great for both.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Let’s say I issue a pull request. Whose job is it to merge it?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> That depends on the workflow you and your team settle on—different teams tend to work very differently in this regard.</p>
        <p>One approach is to designate one or more members of your team—perhaps those with more experience who can make sure that all the i’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed before they merge the pull request.</p>
        <p>Other teams often set a constraint that at least two other members must look at the pull request and give their approval before the pull request is merged.</p>
        <p>Remember, the role of a pull request is to allow for communication, collaboration, and often knowledge sharing. Whatever works best for you and your team is what you should be doing. There are no wrong answers here.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: The pull request creation form asks for a title and a description. What’s all that about?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Since pull requests are about communication and collaboration, these mechanisms encourage you to be explicit about what changes you are introducing and why.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we have to try one or more different ways to solve a problem. We’ve found that the description is a good place to lay out how we’ve tried to solve the problem at hand and why we chose the approach we did. Providing a good description allows anyone looking over your pull requests to understand why you did what you did.</p>
        <p>Finally, this is a good place to put useful links: for example, if you use a ticketing system in your work, you might link to the relevant ticket.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: You mentioned that the pull request allows others to review my work and suggest changes. If I’ve already issued the pull request and someone catches a typo in a comment or recommends renaming a variable, how do I implement the change?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Great question! You can simply open up your editor, make the suggested changes to your local branch, commit, and push again. The push will take your latest commit and update the remote. The pull request will <strong>automatically</strong> update to reflect all commits on the branch, so your colleagues can take a look at it again or follow along if they like.</p>

But what if it’s a fast-forward merge?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> GitHub’s default behavior is to always create a merge commit. GitHub uses a special flag when merging that forces Git to create a merge commit.</p>
        <p>GitHub does offer other ways to merge branches that don’t create a merge commit, but that’s a conversation for another time. For now, just remember that using the defaults in GitHub will create a merge commit.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I get that GitHub will always create a merge commit. I still don’t get why.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> A merge commit represents the joining of two branches. Having a merge commit show up in your commit history can make it easier to discern when a merge happened (since commits record the timestamp when they were created). Also, since a merge commit has two parents, it’s easy to spot in the Git log output.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What happens if merging two branches results in a merge conflict?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> How very astute of you to ask! If GitHub detects a conflict between the two branches being merged, GitHub will defer to you to resolve it. GitHub, like Git, aims to be as helpful as possible, so it displays all the steps you need to take to resolve the conflict.</p>
        <p>Of course, you can always choose to merge the branch locally, resolve any conflicts (like we did in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>), and then push the merge commit upstream, just like any other push you have done so far. While pull requests are a way to perform a merge, merging locally is always an option available to you.</p>
        <p>By the way, we’ll be talking about ways to avoid this in the next chapter. (Who says cliffhangers have to be relegated to the realm of the suspense genre?)</p>

        <h1>What’s next?</h1>
        <p>It’s been one major milestone after another, hasn’t it? You created your first pull request a few pages back. Then, in your last exercise, you merged it in! Giant strides for one chapter.</p>
        <p>But there are some loose ends that need tying up. Recall that GitHub offers you a button to delete the feature branch after you merge it in. In our last exercise, that was the <code>feat-b</code> branch. We deleted that branch—but only in the remote! What about your local clone? Here’s how things stand right now:</p>

        <p>This is just a characteristic of the distributed nature of Git—when you perform an operation on the remote, like merging two branches or deleting branches, your local clone is completely unaware that anything has happened.</p>
        <p>We know how to update the remote with new commits or new branches, using variations of the <code>git push</code> command. But how do we synchronize the local with changes that happened in the remote? How do you get the merge commit down to your remote? Well, that’s the topic of our next chapter.</p>

So now, will Git let you delete the <code>feat-b</code> branch in your clone? Compare the commit histories on the previous page to see if you can figure this one out. Here’s a hint: think about the “reachability” (see the end of <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> when we spoke about deleting branches if you need a refresher) of commit “G” if you were to delete the <code>feat-b</code> branch.</p>

        <h5>Bullet Points</h5>
        <ul>
        <li><p>When you push your commits to the remote, Git synchronizes the commit history between the clone and the remote. This includes all commits and their commit IDs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Any commits that are pushed to the remote are now public commits. Once you push, you should refrain from performing any operation that changes this history: for example, don’t do a <code>git reset</code> or amend a commit message (which would change the commit ID).</p></li>
        <li><p>Working with a clone is no different than working with any other Git repository. If you are working on a new feature or fixing a bug, you should create branches based on an integration branch, like <code>master</code>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once you are done working on a branch, you have two options to merge your code into an integration branch:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The first option is to merge into an integration branch locally, then push the integration branch to the remote.</p></li>
        <li><p>The second option is “merging in public,” where you use the Git repository to perform a merge. GitHub offers “pull requests” to perform merges. Other repository managers offer similar facilities.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>If you choose to use pull requests, you will start by pushing the feature branch to the remote.</p></li>
        <li><p>To push a (new) local branch that the remote does not know about, you will use the <code>git push</code> command, paired with the <code>set-upstream</code> (or its shorter version, <code>-u</code>) flag. This lets you specify the name of the remote and the name of the branch that you want to create in the remote.</p></li>
        <li><p>After a local branch has been pushed to the remote, you can issue a pull request, where you pick the target (or base) branch—that is, the branch to merge into—and the source, or the branch that you wish to merge.</p></li>
        <li><p>A pull request (or merge request) allows fellow collaborators to review the changes you wish to merge. You can even start a conversation about them.</p></li>
        <li><p>GitHub’s web interface allows you to merge your changes into the integration branch and delete the feature branch. (Don’t forget to delete the feature branch!)</p></li>
        <li><p>Since the remote is unaware of the clone, deleting a branch in the remote does not delete the local branch in the clone. You have to do this yourself.</p></li>

        <p>Let’s spend a little time thinking about the difference between the remote and the clone—you’ve merged the <code>feat-b</code> branch into <code>master</code> using a pull request, and deleted the <code>feat-b</code> branch in the remote. So now, will Git let you delete the <code>feat-b</code> branch in your clone? Compare the commit histories on the previous page to see if you can figure this one out. Here’s a hint: think about the “reachability” (see the end of <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#branching_outcolon_multiple_trains_of_th">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> when we spoke about deleting branches if you need a refresher) of commit “G” if you were to delete the <code>feat-b</code> branch.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Git will NOT let you delete the feat-b branch without using the -D (force) option to the branch command. This is because although feat-b was merged <u>into the master</u> branch in the remote, your clone is unaware of that! So if you were to delete the feat-b branch in your clone, commit “G” has no other references to it, making it unreachable. If you could fetch the merge commit from the remote first, then commit “G” will be reachable even after feat-b is deleted.</span></p>
