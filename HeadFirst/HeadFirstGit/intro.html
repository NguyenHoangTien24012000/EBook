        <p>Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, <em>waiting</em> for something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive.</p>
        <p>So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things you encounter? Everything it <em>can</em> to stop them from interfering with the brain’s <em>real</em> job—recording things that <em>matter</em>. It doesn’t bother saving the boring things; they never make it past the “this is obviously not important” filter.</p>
        <p>How does your brain <em>know</em> what’s important? Suppose you’re out for a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you. What happens inside your head and body?</p>
        <p>Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. <em>Chemicals surge</em>.</p>
        <p>And that’s how your brain knows...</p>

        <p>But imagine you’re at home or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger-free zone. You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, 10 days at the most.</p>
        <p>Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s trying to make sure that this <em>obviously</em> unimportant content doesn’t clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really <em>big</em> things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you should never have posted those “party” photos on your Facebook page. And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey brain, thank you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how little I’m registering on the emotional Richter scale right now, I really <em>do</em> want you to keep this stuff around.”</p>

        <h5>We think of a “Head First” reader as a <u>learner</u>.</h5>
        <p><strong>So what does it take to learn something? First you have to get it, then make sure you don’t forget it. It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, learning takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Some of the Head First learning principles:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Make it visual.</strong> Images are far more memorable than words alone, and make learning much more effective (up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). They also make things more understandable. <strong>Put the words within or near the graphics</strong> they relate to, rather than on the bottom or on another page, and learners will be up to <em>twice</em> as likely to be able to solve problems related to the content.</p>
        <p><strong>Use a conversational and personalized style.</strong> In recent studies, students performed up to 40% better on post-learning tests if the content spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, conversational style rather than taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Which would <em>you</em> pay more attention to: a stimulating dinner party companion, or a lecture?</p>
        <p><strong>Get the learner to think more deeply.</strong> Unless you actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head. A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need challenges, exercises, and thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the brain and multiple senses.</p>
        <p><strong>Get—and keep—the reader’s attention.</strong> We’ve all had the “I really want to learn this but I can’t stay awake past page one” experience. Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it’s not.</p>
        <p><strong>Touch their emotions.</strong> We now know that your ability to remember something is largely dependent on its emotional content. You remember what you care about. You remember when you <em>feel</em> something. No, we’re not talking heart-wrenching stories about a kid and a dog. We’re talking emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the...?” and the feeling of “I rule!” that comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” Bob from engineering <em>doesn’t</em>.</p>

        <p>If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.</p>
        <p>Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were <em>expected</em> to learn, but rarely <em>taught</em> to learn.</p>
        <p>But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you really want to learn how to use Git. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time on it. If you want to use what you read in this book, you need to <em>remember</em> what you read. And for that, you’ve got to <em>understand</em> it. To get the most from this book, or <em>any</em> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <em>this</em> content.</p>
        <p>The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.</p>
        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="So just how DO you get your brain to treat Git like it’s a hungry tiger?"><div class="sect2" id="so_just_how_do_you_get_your_brain_to_tre">
        <h2>So just how <em>DO</em> you get your brain to treat Git like it’s a hungry tiger?</h2>
        <p>There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <em>are</em> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <em>feel</em> important, but they keep looking at the same thing <em>over</em> and <em>over</em> and <em>over</em>, so I suppose it must be.”</p>
        <p>The faster way is to do <strong><em>anything that increases brain activity</em></strong>, especially different <em>types</em> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <em>within</em> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else on the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to make sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <em>get</em> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p>
        <p>A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <em>care</em> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p>
        <p>But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning…</p>

        <section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Here’s what WE did"><div class="sect1" id="hereapostrophes_what_we_did">
        <h1>Here’s what WE did</h1>
        <p>We used <strong><em>visuals</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a visual really <em>is</em> worth a thousand words. And when text and visuals work together, we embedded the text <em>in</em> the visuals because your brain works more effectively when the text is <em>within</em> the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in a paragraph somewhere.</p>
        <p>We used <strong><em>redundancy</em></strong>, saying the same thing in <em>different</em> ways and with different media types, and <em>multiple senses</em>, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p>
        <p>We used concepts and visuals in <strong><em>unexpected</em></strong> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used visuals and ideas with at least <em>some</em> <strong><em>emotional</em></strong> <em>content</em>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to <em>feel</em> something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little <strong><em>humor</em></strong>, <strong><em>surprise</em></strong>, or <strong><em>interest</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>We used a personalized, <strong><em>conversational style</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re <em>reading</em>.</p>
        <p>We included dozens of <strong><em>activities</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you <strong><em>do</em></strong> things than when you <em>read</em> about things. And we made the exercises challenging yet doable, because that’s what most people prefer.</p>
        <p>We used <strong><em>multiple learning styles</em></strong>, because <em>you</em> might prefer step-by-step procedures, while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants to see an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, <em>everyone</em> benefits from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.</p>
        <p>We include content for <strong><em>both sides of your brain</em></strong>, because the more of your brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time.</p>
        <p>And we included <strong><em>stories</em></strong> and exercises that present <strong><em>more than one point of view</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make evaluations and judgments.</p>
        <p>We included <strong><em>challenges</em></strong>, with exercises, and we asked <strong><em>questions</em></strong> that don’t always have a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to <em>work</em> at something. Think about it—you can’t get your <em>body</em> in shape just by <em>watching</em> people at the gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the <em>right</em> things. That <strong><em>you’re not spending one extra dendrite</em></strong> processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.</p>
        <p>We used <strong><em>people</em></strong>. In stories, examples, visuals, etc., because, well, because <em>you’re</em> a person. And your brain pays more attention to <em>people</em> than it does to <em>things</em>.</p>

        <p>So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a starting point; listen to your brain and figure out what works for you and what doesn’t. Try new things.</p>
        <div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
        <p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Cut this out and stick it on your refrigerator.</span></p>
        </div>
        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.</strong></p>
        <p>Don’t just <em>read</em>. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine that someone really <em>is</em> asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of learning and remembering.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Do the exercises. Write your own notes.</strong></p>
        <p>We put them in, but if we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don’t just <em>look</em> at the exercises. <strong>Use a pencil</strong>. There’s plenty of evidence that physical activity <em>while</em> learning can increase the learning.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Read the “There Are No Dumb Questions.”</strong></p>
        <p>That means all of them. They’re not optional sidebars, <strong><em>they’re part of the core content!</em></strong> Don’t skip them.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Make this the last thing you read before bed. Or at least the last challenging thing.</strong></p>
        <p>Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens <em>after</em> you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put in something new during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Talk about it. Out loud.</strong></p>
        <p>Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If you’re trying to understand something, or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were reading about it.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Drink water. Lots of it.</strong></p>
        <p>Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration (which can happen before you ever feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Listen to your brain.</strong></p>
        <p>Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Feel something.</strong></p>
        <p>Your brain needs to know that this <em>matters</em>. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is <em>still</em> better than feeling nothing at all.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Use it everyday!</strong></p>
        <p>There’s only one way to learn how to <em>really</em> use Git: <strong>use it everyday</strong>. You are going to be using Git a lot in this book, and like any other skill, and the only way to get good at it is to practice. We’re going to give you a lot of practice: every chapter has exercises that pose a problem for you to solve. Don’t just skip over them—a lot of the learning happens when you solve the exercises. We included a solution to each exercise—don’t be afraid to <strong>peek at the solution</strong> if you get stuck! (It’s easy to get snagged on something small.) But try to solve the problem before you look at the solution. And definitely get it working before you move on to the next part of the book.</p></li>

        <h1>Read me</h1>
        <p>This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out everything that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.</p>

        <h2>We break things down, then build them back again.</h2>
        <p>We are fans of teasing things apart. This gives us the chance to focus on one aspect of Git at a time. We use a lot of visuals to explain what Git is doing when you perform any operation. We make sure you have a deep understanding of each aspect and the confidence to know when and how to use them. Only <em>then</em> do we start to bring things together, to explain the more complex ideas in Git.</p>

        <h2>We don’t exhaustively cover everything.</h2>
        <p>We use the 80/20 approach. We assume that if you are going for a PhD in Git, this isn’t going to be your only book. So we don’t talk about everything. Just the stuff that you’ll actually use, and that you’ll need to hit the ground running.</p>

        <h2>The activities are NOT optional.</h2>
        <p>The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some will help you apply what you’ve learned. <strong><em>Don’t skip the exercises</em></strong>. The crossword puzzles are the only thing you don’t <em>have</em> to do, but they’re good for giving your brain a chance to think about the words and terms you’ve been learning in a different context.</p>

        <p>One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to <em>really</em> get it. And we want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about <em>learning</em>, so you’ll see some of the same concepts come up more than once.</p>

        <section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="The examples are as generic as possible."><div class="sect2" id="the_examples_are_as_generic_as_possibled">
        <h2>The examples are as generic as possible.</h2>
        <p>Most tutorials for Git specifically target developers, and the examples usually involve code. We make no such assumptions about you. We’ve deliberately made the examples in this book generic yet interesting, fascinating—and downright fun. We’re certain you will be able to relate to them and learn how to use Git, no matter what kind of work you do.</p>
        <p>Finally, we want you to learn about Git; we’re not looking to teach you how to type. To make things easier, we’ve placed all the example files on the web so you can simply download them. You’ll find instructions at <em><a href="https://i-love-git.com">https://i-love-git.com</a></em>.</p>

        <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
        <p>Writing a book is often viewed as a solitary activity. But no one is an island. I can only aspire to personify the values imparted upon me by my family, teachers, and mentors. My work is built on the shoulders of giants—technologists from the past and present who worked, and continue to work, tirelessly to make the world a better place. You may see my name on the cover, but a lot of the credit for this book goes to these individuals.</p>
        
        <p><strong><em>My editor:</em></strong></p>

        <p>My biggest thanks to my editor <strong>Sarah Grey</strong>. She read every chapter multiple times, did all the exercises, course-corrected when I ventured too deep into the weeds, and kept me on track to deliver this book to you in time. If you find yourself salivating at the delicious menu listings in this book, or getting teary-eyed when reading the poetry, well, the credit for all that goes to Sarah. She has been instrumental in bringing this book from early development all the way to production. I am truly blessed to have an editor like Sarah.</p>
        <p><strong><em>The O’Reilly team:</em></strong></p>
        <p>A big thanks to the entire O’Reilly Media team, including <strong>Kristen Brown</strong> for making sure that our book was production worthy, and to <strong>Sharon Tripp</strong> for the keen and astute eye when copyediting. And like me, if you are someone who routinely uses the index, you have <strong>Tom Dinse</strong> to thank.</p>
        <p>I’d like to thank <strong>Melissa Duffield</strong> for being so supportive (and patient) throughout this process and <strong>Ryan Shaw</strong> for considering me for this project.</p>
        <p>Much appreciation toward the O’Reilly online training team, specifically <strong>John Devins</strong> and <strong>Yasmina Greco</strong> for giving me a platform to teach Git (among other things) to thousands of developers around the world.</p>
        <p>A shoutout to the <strong>Early Release team</strong>, who put out raw and unedited chapters for the audience on the O’Reilly platform to review as they were written. This gave a chance for many of our readers to submit errata and feedback that made this book just that much better.</p>
        <p>Finally, I’d be remiss if I did not mention <strong>Elisabeth Robson</strong> and <strong>Eric Freeman</strong>. They took the time to review my work and ensure that it aligned with the vision that is the Head First series—not to mention gave some really useful InDesign tips—thank you!</p>

        <h1>Just when you thought there wouldn’t be any more acknowledgments*</h1>
        <p><strong><em>Thanks to:</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jay Zimmerman</strong>, director of the No Fluff Just Stuff (NFJS) conference circuit. Thank you for giving me a shot a decade ago. This opened the door for me to speak at conferences throughout the United States and around the world and meet distinguished and accomplished individuals who, to this day, continue to inspire me. Public speaking also gave me the chance to teach and speak about Git, and my regular interactions with smart and talented audiences helped hone a lot of the material you’ll find in this book.</p>
        <p><strong>Venkat Subramaniam</strong>, world-famous speaker, teacher, consultant, prolific author with an uncanny ability to make the hard stuff fun, friend and mentor—you are an inspiration to me. I realize that I can only shoot for the moon and hope that I land among the stars.</p>
        <p><strong>Mark Richards</strong>, fellow author at O’Reilly, highly regarded architect and speaker around the world, and wonderful human being—you unwittingly set the wheels in motion for this book to happen.</p>
        <p><strong>Matthew McCullough</strong> and <strong>Tim Berglund</strong>, who a long time ago produced <em>Mastering Git</em> (<em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mccullough-and-berglund/9781449304737">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mccullough-and-berglund/9781449304737</a></em>) and opened my eyes to the elegance of Git. I’ve been enamored since. You’ll always be my canaries.</p>
        <p>The countless individuals who contribute to Git, and those who enrich the ecosystem around Git by writing detailed technical blog posts, creating informative videos, and answering questions on Stack Overflow—I am humbled by your work, and I hope that this book will be a valuable addition to your valiant efforts. Thank you.</p>
        <p>My eternally patient, much better half, <strong>Michelle</strong>, who shouldered everything that needed to be done so I could focus on this book. Several of the narratives in this book come from her creative mind. I love you.</p>
        <p>My family and my sisters, who (despite their fervent denials) forged me into the individual I am.</p>
        <p><strong>And finally, you, the readers. Your attention is a scarce resource, and I deeply appreciate the time you’ll spend with this book. Happy learning.</strong></p>
        <p>Now go on, Git!</p>

        <p>* The large number of acknowledgments is because we’re testing the theory that everyone mentioned in a book acknowledgment will buy at least one copy, probably more, what with relatives and everything. If you’d like to be in the acknowledgments of our next book and you have a large family, write to us.</p>
