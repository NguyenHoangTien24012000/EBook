        FORTRAN IV computed <code class="literal">go to</code> statement. Each case
        falls through into the next case unless you explicitly disrupt the flow.</p><p>Someone wrote to me once suggesting that JSLint should give a warning when a case
        falls through into another case. He pointed out that this is a very common source of
        errors, and it is a difficult error to see in the code. I answered that that was all
        true, but that the benefit of compactness obtained by falling through more than
        compensated for the chance of error.</p><p>The next day, he reported that there was an error in JSLint. It was misidentifying
        an error. I investigated, and it turned out that I had a case that was falling
        through. In that moment, I achieved enlightenment. I no longer use intentional fall
        throughs. That discipline makes it much easier to find the unintentional fall
        throughs.</p><p>The worst features of a language aren't the features that are obviously dangerous
        or useless. Those are easily avoided. The worst features are the attractive
        nuisances, the features that are both useful and dangerous.</p></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780596517748/files/core.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
