        Errors</em></span></span></span></div></div><p>When C was a young programming language, there were several common programming errors
    that were not caught by the primitive compilers, so an accessory program called <code class="literal">lint</code> was developed that would scan a source file, looking
    for problems.</p><p>As C matured, the definition of the language was strengthened to eliminate some
    insecurities, and compilers got better at issuing warnings. <code class="literal">lint</code> is no longer needed.</p><p>JavaScript is a young-for-its-age language. It was originally intended to do small
    tasks in web pages, tasks for which Java was too heavy and clumsy. But JavaScript is a
    very capable language, and it is now being used in larger projects. Many of the features
    that were intended to make the language easy to use are troublesome for larger projects.
    A <code class="literal">lint</code> for JavaScript is needed: JSLint, a JavaScript
    syntax checker and verifier.</p><p>JSLint is a code quality tool for JavaScript. It takes a source text and scans it. If
    it finds a problem, it returns a message describing the problem and an approximate
    location within the source. The problem is not necessarily a syntax error, although it
    often is. JSLint looks at some style conventions as well as structural problems. It does
    not prove that your program is correct. It just provides another set of eyes to help
    spot problems.</p><p>JSLint defines a professional subset of JavaScript, a stricter language than that
    defined by the third edition of the <span class="emphasis"><em>ECMAScript Language
        Specification</em></span>. The subset is closely related to the style recommendations
    from <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Style">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0583" class="indexterm"></a></p><p>JavaScript is a sloppy language, but inside it there is an elegant, better language.
    JSLint helps you to program in that better language and to avoid most of the
    slop.</p><p>JSLint can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.JSLint.com/">http://www.JSLint.com/</a>.</p><div class="sect1" title="Undefined Variables and Functions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="undefined_variables_and_functions" class="noOutline" tabindex="-1"></a>Undefined Variables and Functions</h1></div></div></div><p>JavaScript's biggest problem is its dependence on global variables, particularly
        implied global variables. If a variable is not explicitly declared (usually with the
            <code class="literal">var</code> statement), then JavaScript assumes that
        the variable was global. This can mask misspelled names and other
            problems.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0584" class="indexterm"></a><a id="IDX-APP-C-0585" class="indexterm"></a><a id="IDX-APP-C-0586" class="indexterm"></a><a id="IDX-APP-C-0587" class="indexterm"></a><a id="IDX-APP-C-0588" class="indexterm"></a><a id="IDX-APP-C-0589" class="indexterm"></a></p><p>JSLint expects that all variables and functions will be declared before they are
        used or invoked. This allows it to detect implied global variables. It is also good
        practice because it makes programs easier to read.<a id="IDX-APP-C-0590" class="indexterm"></a><a id="IDX-APP-C-0591" class="indexterm"></a></p><p>Sometimes a file is dependent on global variables and functions that are defined
        elsewhere. You can identify these to JSLint by including a comment in your file that
        lists the global functions and objects that your program depends on, but that are
        not defined in your program or script file.</p><p>A global declaration comment can be used to list all of the names that you are
        intentionally using as global variables. JSLint can use this information to identify
        misspellings and forgotten <code class="literal">var</code> declarations. A
        global declaration can look like this:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e9444"></a><pre class="programlisting">/*global getElementByAttribute, breakCycles, hanoi */</pre><p>A global declaration starts with <code class="literal">/*global</code>.
        Notice that there is no space before the <code class="literal">g</code>. You
        can have as many <code class="literal">/*global</code> comments as you like.
        They must appear before the use of the variables they specify.</p><p>Some globals can be predefined for you (see the later section "<a class="xref" href="apcs03.html" title="Options">Options</a>"). Select the "Assume a browser" (<code class="literal">browser</code>) option to predefine the standard global properties that are
        supplied by web browsers, such as <code class="literal">window</code> and
            <code class="literal">document</code> and <code class="literal">alert</code>. Select the "Assume Rhino" (<code class="literal">rhino</code>) option to predefine the global properties provided by the
        Rhino environment. Select the "Assume a Yahoo Widget" (<code class="literal">widget</code>) option to predefine the global properties provided by the
        Yahoo! Widgets environment.</p></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780596517748/files/core.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
