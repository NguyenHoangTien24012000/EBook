However, they are different concepts.</p><p>Polymorphism is a concept found on types whereas duck typing is found on contracts. With polymorphism, it is important <span class="strong"><strong>what an object is</strong></span> and not how it behaves. In duck typing, it is important <span class="strong"><strong>how an object behaves</strong></span>. Duck typing is more tied to the concept of objects that interact, rather than objects that are of a certain type.</p><p>However, duck typing can help to implement solutions that strongly typed languages resolve with true polymorphism. Let's consider an example where our software house wants to implement a method that creates a list of full names of all the employees. The list of employees of the software house can contain not only developers but also salesmen, business analysts, system architects, and so on. Each of these categories of objects may have different ways to store their&nbsp;full name. For example, the following could be the class definitions of a developer, salesman, and business analyst:</p><pre class="programlisting">class Developer { 
        constructor(name, surname) { 
          this.name = name; 
          this.surname = surname; 
        } 
      } 
       
      class Salesman { 
        constructor(name, surname) { 
          this.firstName = name; 
          this.secondName = surname; 
        } 
      } 
       
      class BusinessAnalyst { 
        constructor(fullName) { 
          this.fullName = fullNname; 
        } 
      } 
      </pre><p>These different ways to define the name and surname of the employees of our software house force the <code class="literal">SoftwareHouse</code> class to implement the listing method as in the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">class SoftwareHouse { 
        constructor() { 
          this.employees = []; 
        } 
       
        listEmployees() { 
          var employeesLen = this.employees.length; 
          var currentEmployee; 
       
          for(var i = 0; i &lt; employeesLen; i++) { 
            currentEmployee =  this.employees[i]; 
       
            if (currentEmployee instanceof Developer) { 
              console.log(currentEmployee.name + " " +          currentEmployee.surname); 
            } else if (currentEmployee instanceof Salesman) { 
              console.log(currentEmployee.firstName + " " +          currentEmployee.secondName); 
            } else if (currentEmployee instanceof BusinessAnalyst) { 
              console.log(currentEmployee.fullName); 
            } 
          } 
        } 
      } 
      </pre><p>The <code class="literal">listEmployees()</code> method checks the type of instance of each employee and writes to the console their full name based on the specific structure of the object. This code is very ugly and difficult to maintain. If the software house decides to hire a new type of employee, such as system architects, we should change the method's implementation in order to check this new type of employee and compose its full name.</p><p>A better way to manage such a situation is to use duck typing by enforcing each class to implement a <code class="literal">getFullName()</code> method. In this way, each type of employee will have the responsibility to give its full name. Let's take a look at how we can implement all that.</p><p>First of all, let's create an interface to define our contract:</p><pre class="programlisting">var IFullName = new Interface("IFullName", ["getFullName"]); 
      </pre><p>Thanks to this new approach, the code of our <code class="literal">SoftwareHouse</code> class will be more simple and maintainable:</p><pre class="programlisting">class SoftwareHouse { 
        constructor() { 
          this.employees = []; 
        } 
       
        listEmployees() { 
          var employeesLen = this.employees.length; 
          var currentEmployee; 
       
          for(var i = 0; i &lt; employeesLen; i++) { 
            currentEmployee =  this.employees[i]; 
       
            IFullName.isImplementedBy(currentEmployee); 
            console.log(currentEmployee.getFullName()); 
          } 
        } 
      } 
      </pre><p>This approach will correctly manage possible new types of employees that implement the <code class="literal">IFullName</code> interface. Obviously, checking of the interface implementation should be done when a new employee is added to the <code class="literal">employees</code> array, for example, in the <code class="literal">hire()</code> method we have implemented in previous examples.</p><p>This example shows how we can use duck typing to overcome the limitation of true polymorphism support in JavaScript.</p></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
