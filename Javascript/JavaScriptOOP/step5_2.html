As in a business context, a contract is an agreement between two or more parties for the doing of something specified. For example, in the interaction between two software components, such as objects, we can establish how an object can ask another object to perform some actions in order to achieve a specific goal. With reference to our example of a software house that wants to hire developers, the contract between it and the candidates establishes that the developer must be able to write code.</p><p>So, while a contract is a general agreement between two software components in order to achieve a specific goal, an <span class="strong"><strong>interface</strong></span> is the formal terms of the contract, the details of the agreement that the components must be compliant with. We can say that an interface is the concrete part of a contract, a description of the members that an object must have in order to interact with another object for a specific purpose so that their existence can be checked.</p><p>Of course all objects have an interface, that is, all of the public methods and properties belonging to that object. But here, we are focusing on the set of members of an object that allow it to be compliant with a contract. So, this set can be all the object's members or just a subset.</p><p>Many OOP languages support interfaces by means of specific syntactical constructs. For example, C# and Java have a similar syntax to define an interface. The following code defines an interface that establishes what is needed for an object in order to be hired by our software house:</p><pre class="programlisting">public interface IProgrammer 
{ 
  ModularCode writeCode(); 
} 
</pre><p>In this case, the interface requires that an object has a method named <code class="literal">writeCode()</code> returning an instance of the <code class="literal">ModularCode</code> class. The interface definition is syntactically similar to a class definition, but it has just public members and no implementation. Mostly, in C#, a naming convention requires that the name of an interface starts with a capitalized i, although it is not a syntactic requirement.</p><p>Most strongly typed languages, such as C# and Java, consider an interface like a type definition so that we can use the interface itself wherever we can use a type. For example, we can define a method for hiring developers in the following way:</p><pre class="programlisting">public void Hire(IProgrammer dev) 
{ 
  ... 
} 
</pre><p>In this case, the type system will check whether an object passed to the <code class="literal">Hire()</code> method implements the required method or, as usually it is said, whether it implements the <code class="literal">IProgrammer</code> interface.</p><p>When we want to define a class that complies with the contract formalized by an interface, we have to declare it using a specific syntactical construct. For example, in C# we can define a class implementing the <code class="literal">IProgrammer</code> interface as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">public class DevStudent: IProgrammer { 
  ... 
} 
</pre><p>In Java, we will use the following syntax:</p><pre class="programlisting">public class DevStudent implements IProgrammer { 
  ... 
} 
</pre><p>It is important to point out that an interface establishes the minimum set of features required to comply with a contract, that is, to interact with another object. An object can implement other methods or properties that are not included in an interface. It also can implement more than one interface.</p></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
