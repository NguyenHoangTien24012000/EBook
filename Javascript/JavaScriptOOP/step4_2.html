The first and simplest approach is based on the literal notation:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = {name: "John", surname: "Smith"}; 
    </pre><p>The second and more flexible approach is based on a constructor function:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Person(name, surname) { 
      this.name = name; 
      this.surname = surname; 
    } 
     
    var person = new Person("John", "Smith"); 
    </pre><p>There is no difference between the resulting objects of both approaches. Our feeling in both cases is that we have created two new objects from scratch. Actually, it is not true. In both cases, we created a derived object—an object derived from an instance of the built-in <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor. It is a constructor that allows us to create a base object of all JavaScript objects—the empty object {}. Every object created using the literal notation or a constructor inherits all properties and methods of an instance of the empty object.</p><p>We can verify it by trying to call the <code class="literal">toString()</code>method:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = {name: "John", surname: "Smith"}; 
     
    person.toString();    //result: "[object Object]" 
    </pre><p>We have not defined the <code class="literal">toString()</code> method; however, any object created using literal notation or a constructor function will have attached this method and some others inherited from the empty object. Moreover, even if we created an object using the literal notation, it also has a constructor associated. We can verify this using the inherited <code class="literal">constructor</code> property:</p><pre class="programlisting">person.constructor.name;    //result: "Object" 
    </pre><p>We also can check that our object is an instance of the <code class="literal">Object</code> constructor using the <code class="literal">instanceof</code> operator:</p><pre class="programlisting">console.log(person instanceof Object);  //result: true 
    </pre><p>All these tools confirm that the ways we know until now to create objects do not create objects from scratch, but create objects derived from an empty instance of the <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor.</p><p>In JavaScript terminology, we say that the empty object is the <span class="strong"><strong>prototype</strong></span> of our objects.</p><div class="section" title="What is a prototype?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec25"></a>What is a prototype?</h2></div></div></div><p>A prototype is an object that acts as a template for another object. We have no classes in JavaScript, so features are shared between objects through other objects taken as reference. In other words, if we need an object that is similar to an existing object A, we create a new object B saying that its prototype is the existing object A. This is the basic mechanism of JavaScript's inheritance.</p><p>All objects in JavaScript have a prototype, including functions. When we create an object using the literal notation, the prototype of the new object is the empty object <code class="literal">{}</code>. When we create an object using a constructor function, the prototype of the new object is the prototype of the constructor function.</p><p>We can access the prototype of an object in two ways.</p><p>The first way is using the <code class="literal">prototype</code> property of its constructor. For example, if we have an object created using the <code class="literal">Person()</code> constructor, we can put the prototype of the object in a variable as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">var prototypeOfperson = person.constructor.prototype; 
    </pre><p>This approach is also valid for objects created with the literal notation, since they have a constructor function as well, the <code class="literal">Object()</code> constructor.</p><p>The second way to access an object's prototype is using the <code class="literal">Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> method, as shown here:</p><pre class="programlisting">var prototypeOfperson = Object.getPrototypeOf(person); 
    </pre><p>In both approaches we get the object that acts as the template of the <code class="literal">person</code> object.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note7"></a>Note</h3><p>A popular way to access an object's prototype uses the <code class="literal">__proto__</code> pseudo-property. This property was originally born as an internal property supported by some JavaScript engines in the browser environment to link an object to its prototype. Given its widespread support, ECMAScript 6 specifications standardized it, but added the <code class="literal">__proto__</code> property to the standard as a deprecated feature, to be used just for compatibility with legacy code.</p></div></div><p>We can check if an object is the prototype of another object using the <code class="literal">isPrototypeOf()</code> method owned by every object:</p><pre class="programlisting">var p = Object.getPrototypeOf(person); 
     
    console.log(p.isPrototypeOf(person));    //result: true 
    console.log(person.isPrototypeOf(p));    //result: false 
    </pre><p>From this example, we can see that the prototype relation between objects is not a symmetric relation; that is, if object A is the prototype of object B, object B cannot be the prototype of object A.</p></div><div class="section" title="Creating objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec26"></a>Creating objects</h2></div></div></div><p>The discussion concerning objects and prototypes bring us to affirm that object creation and inheritance are strictly connected. The two ways to create objects in JavaScript that we have seen, using literal notation and via a constructor function, generate objects with a built-in prototype. So, we have two questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Can we create objects without a prototype?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Can we create object with a specific prototype?</li></ul></div><p>The answer to both questions is affirmative and the solution is the <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method. This method allows us to create JavaScript objects using a functional approach and giving us more flexibility.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note8"></a>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method was proposed by Douglas Crockford as a true functional alternative to using the <code class="literal">new</code> keyword and constructors, considered by him as not coherent with the nature of JavaScript.</p></div></div><p>We can create an object without a prototype in the following way:</p><pre class="programlisting">var myObject = Object.create(null); 
    </pre><p>In this case, the <code class="literal">myObject</code> variable will contain an object without a prototype. It will not inherit the empty object features, so it will not have <code class="literal">toString()</code> and other standard methods we have seen earlier. If we try to check what the prototype of the object is, we will obtain the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(myObject));     //result: null 
    </pre><p>The prototype of the object is <code class="literal">null</code>. Just the value we passed to the <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method. In order to create an object whose prototype is another object we can specify it as the argument of <code class="literal">Object.create()</code>, as shown below:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = { name: "John", surname: "Smith"}; 
     
    var myObject = Object.create(person); 
    </pre><p>Now <code class="literal">myObject</code> will have the <code class="literal">person</code> object as its prototype.</p><p>When creating an object with the&nbsp;<code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method, we can specify new properties for the new object. These properties can be specified as the second optional parameter of the <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method, as shown in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = { name: "", surname: ""}; 
    var developer = Object.create( 
              person, 
              { knownLanguage: 
                {   writable: true, 
                  configurable: true 
                } 
              }); 
    </pre><p>Here, we added the <code class="literal">knownLanguage</code> property to the <code class="literal">developer</code> object by specifying a property descriptor. As result, the developer object will have the properties inherited from its prototype object and the new property defined at the creation stage.</p><p>In addition to associating a prototype during the creation of an object with the&nbsp;<code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method, we can also assign a prototype to an object after the object is created. We can make this by using the <code class="literal">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> method defined by ECMAScript 6 specifications. The following is an example of how we can use this method:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = {name: "John", surname: "Smith" }; 
    var developer = { knownLanguage: "JavaScript" }; 
     
    Object.setPrototypeOf(developer, person); 
    </pre><p>In this way, we assigned the <code class="literal">person</code> object as the prototype of the <code class="literal">developer</code> object. This instantly causes the <code class="literal">developer</code> object to inherit the <code class="literal">person</code>'s members <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">surname</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">console.log(developer.name);       //result: "John" 
    console.log(developer.surname);    //result: "Smith" 
    </pre><p>This is a sort of object combination executed at runtime. In fact, the <code class="literal">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> method allows us to change at runtime the prototype of an object, modifying its features. In our example, the initial prototype of both <code class="literal">person</code> and <code class="literal">developer</code> objects was the empty object {}. After applying the <code class="literal">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> method, the <code class="literal">developer&nbsp;</code>prototype has changed.</p><p>Although the <code class="literal">Object.setPrototypeOf()</code> method offers interesting possibilities, it should be pointed out that its use can have negative performance impacts due to dynamically linking the prototype at runtime. Using <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> allows JavaScript engines to statically analyze and optimize the code, while changing prototypes at runtime can have unpredictable effects on the performance.</p></div><div class="section" title="Prototype chaining"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec27"></a>Prototype chaining</h2></div></div></div><p>When creating an object, we have the opportunity to specify its prototype thanks to the <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method. This allows the new object to inherit features of the prototype. Being a regular object, a prototype in turn has its own prototype. Consider, for example, the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">var person = { name: "John", surname: "Smith"}; 
    var developer = Object.create( 
              person, 
              { knownLanguage: 
                {   writable: true, 
                  configurable: true 
                } 
              }); 
    </pre><p>When using the <code class="literal">developer</code> object, we can access the <code class="literal">knownLanguage</code> property, as it was added during the object's creation, and the <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">surname</code> properties, as they are inherited from its prototype, the <code class="literal">person</code> object. However, the <code class="literal">person</code> object has its own prototype. Since it has been created using the literal notation, its prototype is the empty object {}. So, the <code class="literal">person</code> object inherits the standard object's members, such as the <code class="literal">toString()</code> method. We can simply verify that also the <code class="literal">developer</code> object inherits the <code class="literal">toString()</code> method:</p><pre class="programlisting">console.log(developer.toString());    //result: "[object Object]" 
    </pre><p>This shows that inheritance is a relationship among many objects, not just between two objects. An object inherits all members of its prototype and the ones of the prototype's prototype, and so on. The sequence of links between objects through the prototype relationship is usually called <code class="literal">prototype chain</code>.</p><p>But, what does inheriting members from the prototype mean exactly?</p><p>The inheritance mechanism is extremely simple. When we try to access an object's member, the system searches first among the object's members. If the member is not found, the system searches among the members of the object's prototype. If again it is not found, the system goes up the prototype chain until it finds the searched member or it finds a null value. In the first case, the found member's value is returned; otherwise, an <code class="literal">undefined</code> value is returned. The following picture shows how JavaScript goes up the prototype chain in order to access the&nbsp;<code class="literal">toString()</code> method in our previous example:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/graphics/image_04_001.jpg" alt="Prototype chaining" width="757" height="585"></div><p>The way JavaScript looks for an object's members in the prototype chain should make us think about the effects on performance when the chain is too long. In fact, while this mechanism give us a great flexibility and low memory consumption, it has a performance cost. So, we should limit the prototype chain in order to reduce performance issues in our JavaScript applications.</p></div><div class="section" title="Inheritance and constructors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec28"></a>Inheritance and constructors</h2></div></div></div><p>Although basic inheritance&nbsp;in JavaScript is a relationship between objects, we would like to manage it while using object constructors. In other words, we want to have a way that allow us to create objects through a constructor function that inherits features from other objects. This actually would define an inheritance relationship between constructors.</p><p>Let's consider the constructor for person objects:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Person(name, surname) { 
      this.name = name; 
      this.surname =  surname; 
    } 
    </pre><p>We would like to define a constructor for developer objects that inherit features from objects created by the <code class="literal">Person()</code> constructor. The following code achieves this goal:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Developer(name, surname, knownLanguage) { 
    <span class="strong"><strong>  Person.apply(this, arguments);</strong></span> 
      this.knownLanguage =  knownLanguage; 
    } 
    </pre><p>The main difference between a standard constructor is the use of method <code class="literal">apply()</code> of the <code class="literal">Person()</code> constructor. The <code class="literal">apply()</code>method executes the <code class="literal">Person()</code> function by taking the <code class="literal">Developer</code> context and arguments. The final effect is the creation of the <code class="literal">Person</code> function's properties on the <code class="literal">Developer</code> instance.</p><p>When we create an instance of <code class="literal">Developer</code>, we will get an object with <code class="literal">name</code>, <code class="literal">surname</code> and <code class="literal">knownLanguage</code> properties:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = new Developer("John", "Smith", "JavaScript"); 
     
    console.log(johnSmith.name);            //result:  "John" 
    console.log(johnSmith.surname);         //result:  "Smith" 
    console.log(johnSmith.knownLanguage );  //result:  "JavaScript" 
    </pre><p>This approach let's us inherit <code class="literal">Person</code>'s members into <code class="literal">Developer</code> objects. However, it breaks the consistency of the <code class="literal">instanceof</code> operator on the prototype chain. Let's explain with the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = new Developer("John", "Smith", "JavaScript"); 
     
    johnSmith instanceof Developer;    //result:  true 
    johnSmith instanceof Person;       //result:  false 
    johnSmith instanceof Object;       //result:  true 
    </pre><p>Here, we can see that the instance of <code class="literal">Developer</code> is not also&nbsp;considered also an instance of <code class="literal">Person</code>. We should fix this issue by explicitly assign a prototype the <code class="literal">Developer()</code> constructor:</p><pre class="programlisting">Developer.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); 
    Developer.prototype.constructor = Developer; 
    </pre></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
