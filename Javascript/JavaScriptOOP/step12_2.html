Since its appearance, JavaScript and web browsers have established a lasting symbiosis that still holds, although with slightly different roles than in the past. In this context, in fact, we have seen a growing responsibility of JavaScript whose evolution, together with the evolution of HTML, has led us to create applications with an interaction model and an architecture very similar to desktop applications.</p><div class="section" title="Old-style web applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec100"></a>Old-style web applications</h2></div></div></div><p>The traditional architecture of the early web applications consisted (and still consists) of a set of HTML pages, representing the user interface, with JavaScript scripts whose main task was managing the user interaction and rendering some graphic effects. As a part of this architecture, the transition from one screen to the next one implied a request to the server and a whole page loading, with obvious latency, especially if the page was very rich in content (graphics, text, and scripts).</p><p>The following diagram shows the interaction between the client and the server in an hypothetical form data submission:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/graphics/image_12_001.jpg" alt="Old-style web applications" width="500" height="349"></div></div><div class="section" title="Single Page Applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec101"></a>Single Page Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>With Ajax and the new dynamic nature of the DOM, that is the ability to manipulate it at runtime via JavaScript, a new understanding of a web application was born. No longer a collection of pages whose navigation depends on the server, but a set of views under JavaScript's control on the clientâ€”<span class="strong"><strong>Single Page Applications</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>SPA</strong></span> were born.</p><p>Single Page Applications are able to redraw any part of the user interface without requiring a server round-trip to retrieve HTML. This is achieved by separating the data from its presentation and usually applying some variant of MVC design pattern on the client. In fact, in the traditional approach to designing web applications, the client had the role of displaying the View and manage user's interaction, while the server implemented the Controller and the Model, as depicted in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/graphics/image_12_002.jpg" alt="Single Page Applications" width="513" height="425"></div><p>In Single Page Applications, the View and the Controller are implemented into the client, while the server acts as the Model:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/graphics/image_12_003.jpg" alt="Single Page Applications" width="502" height="406"></div><div class="section" title="The server role"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec7"></a>The server role</h3></div></div></div><p>While in traditional web applications, the transition from one screen to another triggered the loading of a new HTML page from the server. In an SPA the server has no role in determining the screen transition. The client composes application views out of HTML templates and data, both of which it requests asynchronously as it needs them.</p><p>So, in the SPA model the server has no UI logic nor maintains any UI state. The role of the server consists in providing resources to the client, starting with the initial HTML for the single web page containing the entire application. The other resources are obtained in response to Ajax requests for data, represented usually by JSON data; but, they can be of different type such as HTML or even JavaScript code. The following picture describes the interactions between the client and the server:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/graphics/image_12_004.jpg" alt="The server role" width="551" height="400"></div></div><div class="section" title="View composition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec8"></a>View composition</h3></div></div></div><p>A Single Page Application is fully loaded in the initial page load and then dynamically updated with new HTML fragments composed by the client upon data loaded from the server. These fragments, usually called Views, make up what users commonly call screens or pages. A View can be a portion of the HTML page, such as a div or the entire screen. When a View occupies the entire screen, we call that a page to reflect the fact that it completely draws the user's attention, but technically it is just another view composed by the client.</p><p>We typically have many views in a SPA, and the resources needed to compose them are incrementally loaded from the server on demand. Since updating Views occurs asynchronously without reloading the entire page, Single Page Applications are more responsive and reduce network traffic and optimize its latency.</p></div><div class="section" title="Navigation and routing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec9"></a>Navigation and routing</h3></div></div></div><p>All modern SPA frameworks support the concept of routing. Routing is the ability to map URLs to Views so that users may navigate within the application's UI. Usually, it is implemented through a service called <span class="strong"><strong>router</strong></span>. The main task of a router is to define how a URL is mapped to a View and to perform the transition between Views in response to a click on some menu item or any user action. If the user has not seen the requested View before, the application may make an HTTP request to the server in order to retrieve the resources and dynamically compose the View. Instead, if the View has already been viewed at least once, the browser may have cached it and the router will be smart enough not to make the HTTP request to the server. This approach helps to reduce round-tripping to and from a server and improve perceived performance.</p></div><div class="section" title="The remote data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec10"></a>The remote data</h3></div></div></div><p>A Single Page Application requests data over HTTP from a server. Usually, we think of data as structured information such as a list of values. From a Single Page Application point of view, data can be different kinds of information: JSON, HTML, or any other resource that the application requires, even JavaScript code. In fact, an SPA can be designed so that its first load into the browser does not contain the entire application, but just the minimum code required to start properly. The rest of the code is dynamically loaded on demand during the user's navigation. Usually, JavaScript code is organized in modules loaded asynchronously using an AMD loader.</p><p>In other words, the data that a SPA requires can be anything the application needs from the server in order to build its Views. So, maybe the term data is not so appropriate, and we should instead use the term resource.</p></div></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
