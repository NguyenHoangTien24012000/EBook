We already talked about the standard ways in which we can create objects, but in some situations, we may need a more sophisticated approach.</p><p>This chapter introduces the group of design patterns known as <span class="strong"><strong>creational patterns</strong></span>, that is, patterns concerning the creation of an object in a structural way. After a reminder on the standard ways to create objects, we will show you how to take advantage of the following patterns:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Singleton pattern</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Factory pattern</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Abstract factory pattern</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Builder pattern</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Object pool pattern</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Creating objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec38"></a>Creating objects</h1></div></div></div><p>We have seen in previous chapters the different ways JavaScript allows us to create objects. We can use the literal notation to create objects in an extremely easy manner or we can apply a constructor function, we can create instances of a <code class="literal">class</code> definition or invoke the <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method. Each approach has its benefits and drawbacks, and we can use what we consider most suitable for our needs.</p><p>The literal notation is the easiest approach. We can just create an object by defining its properties and methods between curly braces:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = { name: "John", surname: "Smith"}; 
</pre><p>The positive side of this approach is its simplicity. The negative side is that we need to specify each property and method and it is not suitable to create many similar objects. Usually, its use is limited to the creation of a single object.</p><p>The creation of objects based on constructor functions or classes allows us to define an object template from which we can create as many objects as we want:</p><pre class="programlisting">function Person(name, surname) { 
  this.name = name; 
  this.surname = surname; 
} 
 
class Person { 
  constructor(name, surname) { 
    this.name = name; 
    this.surname = surname; 
  } 
} 
</pre><p>Regardless of the approach used to define our template, we can create objects using the <code class="literal">new</code> operator:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = new Person("John", "Smith"); 
</pre><p>As we already discussed in <span><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Inheriting and Creating Mixins">Chapter 4</a></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Inheriting and Creating Mixins</em></span>, using constructor functions and classes allows us to optimize memory usage by sharing the method's code among their instances, thanks to prototype and inheritance. However, many have criticized the <code class="literal">new</code> operator because it appears as misleading since it is the same operator usually used to create an object from a class in classical OOP languages. They say that the <code class="literal">new</code> operator is neither coherent with a classless approach of JavaScript OOP nor with the functional nature of the language.</p><p>The alternative approach is based on the <code class="literal">Object.create()</code> method. Like constructor functions and classes, it allows us to create objects from a prototype and is easier to understand and more coherent with JavaScript's nature:</p><pre class="programlisting">var johnSmith = Object.create(); 
johnSmith.name = "John"; 
johnSmith.surname = "Smith"; 
</pre><p>However, not always, these standard approaches to create objects are suitable in certain contexts. Sometimes the object creation process may be complex or require a high level of flexibility. In these situations, we can use some of the most known design patterns to achieve a solution to our specific needs.</p></div></div></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/public/epub-reader/override_v1.css" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781785889103/files/epub.css" crossorigin="anonymous"></div></div></section>
