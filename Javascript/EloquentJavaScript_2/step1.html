        <p class="intro">Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.</p>
        <p class="indent"><em>Bits</em> are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Inside the computer, they take forms such as a high or low electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, or a shiny or dull spot on the surface of a CD. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.</p>
        <p class="indent">For example, we can express the number 13 in bits. It works the same way as a decimal number, but instead of 10 different digits, you have only 2, and the weight of each increases by a factor of 2 from right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number 13, with the weights of the digits shown below them:</p>
        <p class="programs">&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br>128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</p>
        <p class="indent">So that’s the binary number 00001101. Its nonzero digits stand for 8, 4, and 1, and add up to 13.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"></span>Values</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has more than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory). Non-volatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude more.</p>
        <p class="indent">To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called <em>values</em>. Though all values are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on.</p>
        <p class="indent">To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is convenient. You don’t have to gather building material for your values or pay for them. You just call for one, and <em>whoosh</em>, you have it. They are not really created from thin air, of course. Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out of memory. Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of values.</p>
        <p class="indent">This chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs, that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev2">Numbers</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Values of the <em>number</em> type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a JavaScript program, they are written as follows:</p>
        <p class="programs">13</p>
        <p class="indent">Use that in a program, and it will cause the bit pattern for the number 13 to come into existence inside the computer’s memory.</p>
        <p class="indent">JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, 64 of them, to store a single number value. There are only so many patterns you can make with 64 bits, which means that the number of different numbers that can be represented is limited. With <em>N</em> decimal digits, you can represent 10<sup>N</sup> numbers. Similarly, given 64 binary digits, you can represent 2<sup>64</sup> different numbers, which is about 18 quintillion (an 18 with 18 zeros after it). That’s a lot.</p>
        <p class="indent">Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use groups of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to accidentally <em>overflow</em> such small numbers—to end up with a number that did not fit into the given number of bits. Today, even computers that fit in your pocket have plenty of memory, so you are free to use 64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.</p>
        <p class="indent">Not all whole numbers less than 18 quintillion fit in a JavaScript number, though. Those bits also store negative numbers, so one bit indicates the sign of the number. A bigger issue is that nonwhole numbers must also be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"></span>represented. To do this, some of the bits are used to store the position of the decimal point. The actual maximum whole number that can be stored is more in the range of 9 quadrillion (15 zeros)—which is still pleasantly huge.</p>
        <p class="indent">Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.</p>
        <p class="programs">9.81</p>
        <p class="indent">For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by adding an <em>e</em> (for <em>exponent</em>), followed by the exponent of the number.</p>
        <p class="programs">2.998e8</p>
        <p class="indent">That is 2.998 × 10<sup>8</sup> = 299,800,000.</p>
        <p class="indent">Calculations with whole numbers (also called <em>integers</em>) smaller than the aforementioned 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations with fractional numbers are generally not. Just as <em>π</em> (pi) cannot be precisely expressed by a finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them. This is a shame, but it causes practical problems only in specific situations. The important thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as approximations, not as precise values.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev3"><em>Arithmetic</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce a new number from them. Here is what they look like in JavaScript:</p>
        <p class="programs">100 + 4 * 11</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">+</span> and <span class="literal">*</span> symbols are called <em>operators</em>. The first stands for addition, and the second stands for multiplication. Putting an operator between two values will apply it to those values and produce a new value.</p>
        <p class="indent">But does the example mean “add 4 and 100, and multiply the result by 11,” or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might have guessed, the multiplication happens first. But as in mathematics, you can change this by wrapping the addition in parentheses.</p>
        <p class="programs">(100 + 4) * 11</p>
        <p class="indent">For subtraction, there is the <span class="literal">-</span> operator, and division can be done with the <span class="literal">/</span> operator.</p>
        <p class="indent">When operators appear together without parentheses, the order in which they are applied is determined by the <em>precedence</em> of the operators. The example shows that multiplication comes before addition. The <span class="literal">/</span> operator has the same precedence as <span class="literal">*</span>. Likewise for <span class="literal">+</span> and <span class="literal">-</span>. When multiple operators with the same precedence appear next to each other, as in <span class="literal">1 - 2 + 1</span>, they are applied left to right: <span class="literal">(1 - 2) + 1</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"></span>These rules of precedence are not something you should worry about. When in doubt, just add parentheses.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is one more arithmetic operator, which you might not immediately recognize. The <span class="literal">%</span> symbol is used to represent the <em>remainder</em> operation. <span class="literal">X % Y</span> is the remainder of dividing <span class="literal">X</span> by <span class="literal">Y</span>. For example, <span class="literal">314 % 100</span> produces <span class="literal">14</span>, and <span class="literal">144 % 12</span> gives <span class="literal">0</span>. The remainder operator’s precedence is the same as that of multiplication and division. You’ll also often see this operator referred to as <em>modulo</em>.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev4"><em>Special Numbers</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered numbers but don’t behave like normal numbers.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first two are <span class="literal">Infinity</span> and <span class="literal">-Infinity</span>, which represent the positive and negative infinities. <span class="literal">Infinity - 1</span> is still <span class="literal">Infinity</span>, and so on. Don’t put too much trust in infinity-based computation, though. It isn’t mathematically sound, and it will quickly lead to the next special number: <span class="literal">NaN</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="literal">NaN</span> stands for “not a number,” even though it <em>is</em> a value of the number type. You’ll get this result when you, for example, try to calculate <span class="literal">0 / 0</span> (zero divided by zero), <span class="literal">Infinity - Infinity</span>, or any number of other numeric operations that don’t yield a meaningful result.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev5">Strings</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The next basic data type is the <em>string</em>. Strings are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes.</p>
        <p class="programs">`Down on the sea`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"Lie on the ocean"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>'Float on the ocean'</p>
        <p class="indent">You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings, as long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string match.</p>
        <p class="indent">Almost anything can be put between quotes, and JavaScript will make a string value out of it. But a few characters are more difficult. You can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard. <em>Newlines</em> (the characters you get when you press <small>ENTER</small>) can be included without escaping only when the string is quoted with backticks (<span class="literal">`</span>).</p>
        <p class="indent">To make it possible to include such characters in a string, the following notation is used: whenever a backslash (<span class="literal">\</span>) is found inside quoted text, it indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. This is called <em>escaping</em> the character. A quote that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string but be part of it. When an <span class="literal">n</span> character occurs after a backslash, it is interpreted as a newline. Similarly, a <span class="literal">t</span> after a backslash means a tab character. Take the following string:</p>
        <p class="programs">"This is the first line\nAnd this is the second"</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"></span>The actual text contained is this:</p>
        <p class="programs">This is the first line<br>And this is the second</p>
        <p class="indent">There are, of course, situations where you want a backslash in a string to be just a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes follow each other, they will collapse together, and only one will be left in the resulting string value. This is how the string <span class="literal">"A newline character is written like "\n"."</span> can be expressed:</p>
        <p class="programs">"A newline character is written like \"\\n\"."</p>
        <p class="indent">Strings, too, have to be modeled as a series of bits to be able to exist inside the computer. The way JavaScript does this is based on the <em>Unicode</em> standard. This standard assigns a number to virtually every character you would ever need, including characters from Greek, Arabic, Japanese, Armenian, and so on. If we have a number for every character, a string can be described by a sequence of numbers.</p>
        <p class="indent">And that’s what JavaScript does. But there’s a complication: JavaScript’s representation uses 16 bits per string element, which can describe up to 2<sup>16</sup></p>
        <p class="indent">different characters. But Unicode defines more characters than that—about twice as many, at this point. So some characters, such as many emoji, take up two “character positions” in JavaScript strings. We’ll come back to this in “Strings and Character Codes” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#page_92">page 92</a>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted, but the <span class="literal">+</span> operator <em>can</em> be used on them. It does not add, but it <em>concatenates</em>—it glues two strings together. The following line will produce the string <span class="literal">"concatenate"</span>:</p>
        <p class="programs">"con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate"</p>
        <p class="indent">String values have a number of associated functions (<em>methods</em>) that can be used to perform other operations on them. I’ll say more about these in “Methods” on <a href="ch04.xhtml#page_62">page 62</a>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Strings written with single or double quotes behave very much the same—the only difference is in which type of quote you need to escape inside of them. Backtick-quoted strings, usually called <em>template literals</em>, can do a few more tricks. Apart from being able to span lines, they can also embed other values.</p>
        <p class="programs">`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`</p>
        <p class="indent">When you write something inside <span class="literal">${}</span> in a template literal, its result will be computed, converted to a string, and included at that position. The example produces <span class="literal">half of 100 is 50</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"></span>Unary Operators</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words. One example is the <span class="literal">typeof</span> operator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value you give it.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(typeof 4.5)<br>// → number<br>console.log(typeof "x")<br>// → string</p>
        <p class="indent">We will use <span class="literal">console.log</span> in example code to indicate that we want to see the result of evaluating something. More about that in the next chapter.</p>
        <p class="indent">The other operators shown all operated on two values, but <span class="literal">typeof</span> takes only one. Operators that use two values are called <em>binary</em> operators, while those that take one are called <em>unary</em> operators. The minus operator can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary operator.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(- (10 - 2))<br>// → -8</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev7">Boolean Values</h3>
        <p class="noindent">It is often useful to have a value that distinguishes between only two possibilities, like “yes” and “no” or “on” and “off.” For this purpose, JavaScript has a <em>Boolean</em> type, which has just two values, true and false, which are written as those words.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev8"><em>Comparison</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Here is one way to produce Boolean values:</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(3 &gt; 2)<br>// → true<br>console.log(3 &lt; 2)<br>// → false</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">&gt;</span> and <span class="literal">&lt;</span> signs are the traditional symbols for “is greater than” and “is less than,” respectively. They are binary operators. Applying them results in a Boolean value that indicates whether they hold true in this case.</p>
        <p class="indent">Strings can be compared in the same way.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log("Aardvark" &lt; "Zoroaster")<br>// → true</p>
        <p class="indent">The way strings are ordered is roughly alphabetic but not really what you’d expect to see in a dictionary: uppercase letters are always “less” than lowercase ones, so <span class="literal">"Z" &lt; "a"</span>, and nonalphabetic characters (!, -, and so on) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"></span>are also included in the ordering. When comparing strings, JavaScript goes over the characters from left to right, comparing the Unicode codes one by one.</p>
        <p class="indent">Other similar operators are <span class="literal">&gt;=</span> (greater than or equal to), <span class="literal">&lt;=</span> (less than or equal to), <span class="literal">==</span> (equal to), and <span class="literal">!=</span> (not equal to).</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log("Itchy" != "Scratchy")<br>// → true<br>console.log("Apple" == "Orange")<br>// → false<br></p>
        <p class="indent">There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is <span class="literal">NaN</span> (“not a number”).</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(NaN == NaN)<br>// → false</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="literal">NaN</span> is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as such, it isn’t equal to the result of any <em>other</em> nonsensical computations.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev9"><em>Logical Operators</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values themselves. JavaScript supports three logical operators: <em>and, or</em>, and <em>not</em>. These can be used to “reason” about Booleans.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">&amp;&amp;</span> operator represents logical <em>and</em>. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(true &amp;&amp; false)<br>// → false<br>console.log(true &amp;&amp; true)<br>// → true</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">||</span> operator denotes logical <em>or</em>. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(false || true)<br>// → true<br>console.log(false || false)<br>// → false</p>
        <p class="indent"><em>Not</em> is written as an exclamation mark (<span class="literal">!</span>). It is a unary operator that flips the value given to it—<span class="literal">!true</span> produces <span class="literal">false</span>, and <span class="literal">!false</span> gives <span class="literal">true</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">When mixing these Boolean operators with arithmetic and other operators, it is not always obvious when parentheses are needed. In practice, you can usually get by with knowing that of the operators we have seen so far, <span class="literal">||</span> has the lowest precedence, then comes <span class="literal">&amp;&amp;</span>, then the comparison operators (<span class="literal">&gt;</span>, <span class="literal">==</span>, and so on), and then the rest. This order has been chosen such that, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"></span>in typical expressions like the following one, as few parentheses as possible are necessary:</p>
        <p class="programs">1 + 1 == 2 &amp;&amp; 10 * 10 &gt; 50</p>
        <p class="indent">The last logical operator I will discuss is not unary, not binary, but <em>ternary</em>, operating on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like this:</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(true ? 1 : 2);<br>// → 1<br>console.log(false ? 1 : 2);<br>// → 2</p>
        <p class="indent">This one is called the <em>conditional</em> operator (or sometimes just the <em>ternary</em> operator since it is the only such operator in the language). The value on the left of the question mark “picks” which of the other two values will come out. When it is true, it chooses the middle value, and when it is false, it chooses the value on the right.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev10">Empty Values</h3>
        <p class="noindent">There are two special values, written <span class="literal">null</span> and <span class="literal">undefined</span>, that are used to denote the absence of a <em>meaningful</em> value. They are themselves values, but they carry no information.</p>
        <p class="indent">Many operations in the language that don’t produce a meaningful value (you’ll see some later) yield <span class="literal">undefined</span> simply because they have to yield <em>some</em> value.</p>
        <p class="indent">The difference in meaning between <span class="literal">undefined</span> and <span class="literal">null</span> is an accident of JavaScript’s design, and it doesn’t matter most of the time. In cases where you actually have to concern yourself with these values, I recommend treating them as mostly interchangeable.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev11">Automatic Type Conversion</h3>
        <p class="noindent">In the Introduction, I mentioned that JavaScript goes out of its way to accept almost any program you give it, even programs that do odd things. This is nicely demonstrated by the following expressions:</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(8 * null)<br>// → 0<br>console.log("5" - 1)<br>// → 4<br>console.log("5" + 1)<br>// → 51<br>console.log("five" * 2)<br>// → NaN<br>console.log(false == 0)<br>// → true</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"></span>When an operator is applied to the “wrong” type of value, JavaScript will quietly convert that value to the type it needs, using a set of rules that often aren’t what you want or expect. This is called <em>type coercion</em>. The <span class="literal">null</span> in the first expression becomes <span class="literal">0</span>, and the <span class="literal">"5"</span> in the second expression becomes <span class="literal">5</span> (from string to number). Yet in the third expression, <span class="literal">+</span> tries string concatenation before numeric addition, so the <span class="literal">1</span> is converted to <span class="literal">"1"</span> (from number to string).</p>
        <p class="indent">When something that doesn’t map to a number in an obvious way (such as <span class="literal">"five"</span> or <span class="literal">undefined</span>) is converted to a number, you get the value <span class="literal">NaN</span>. Further arithmetic operations on <span class="literal">NaN</span> keep producing <span class="literal">NaN</span>, so if you find yourself getting one of those in an unexpected place, look for accidental type conversions.</p>
        <p class="indent">When comparing values of the same type using <span class="literal">==</span>, the outcome is easy to predict: you should get true when both values are the same, except in the case of <span class="literal">NaN</span>. But when the types differ, JavaScript uses a complicated and confusing set of rules to determine what to do. In most cases, it just tries to convert one of the values to the other value’s type. However, when <span class="literal">null</span> or <span class="literal">undefined</span> occurs on either side of the operator, it produces true only if both sides are one of <span class="literal">null</span> or <span class="literal">undefined</span>.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(null == undefined);<br>// → true<br>console.log(null == 0);<br>// → false</p>
        <p class="indent">That behavior is often useful. When you want to test whether a value has a real value instead of <span class="literal">null</span> or <span class="literal">undefined</span>, you can compare it to <span class="literal">null</span> with the <span class="literal">==</span> (or <span class="literal">!=</span>) operator.</p>
        <p class="indent">But what if you want to test whether something refers to the precise value <span class="literal">false</span>? Expressions like <span class="literal">0 == false</span> and <span class="literal">"" == false</span> are true. When you do <em>not</em> want any automatic type conversions to happen, there are two additional operators: <span class="literal">===</span> and <span class="literal">!==</span>. The first tests whether a value is <em>precisely</em> equal to the other, and the second tests whether it is not precisely equal. So <span class="literal">"" === false</span> is false as expected.</p>
        <p class="indent">I recommend using the three-character comparison operators defensively to prevent unexpected type conversions from tripping you up. But when you’re certain the types on both sides will be the same, there is no problem with using the shorter operators.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev12"><em>Short-Circuiting of Logical Operators</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The logical operators <span class="literal">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="literal">||</span> handle values of different types in a peculiar way. They will convert the value on their left side to Boolean type in order to decide what to do, but depending on the operator and the result of that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"></span>conversion, they will return either the <em>original</em> left-hand value or the right-hand value.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">||</span> operator, for example, will return the value to its left when that can be converted to true and will return the value on its right otherwise. This has the expected effect when the values are Boolean and does something analogous for values of other types.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(null || "user")<br>// → user<br>console.log("Agnes" || "user")<br>// → Agnes</p>
        <p class="indent">We can use this functionality as a way to fall back on a default value. If you have a value that might be empty, you can put <span class="literal">||</span> after it with a replacement value. If the initial value can be converted to false, you’ll get the replacement instead. The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean values state that <span class="literal">0</span>, <span class="literal">NaN</span>, and the empty string (<span class="literal">""</span>) count as <span class="literal">false</span>, while all the other values count as <span class="literal">true</span>. So <span class="literal">0 || -1</span> produces <span class="literal">-1</span>, and <span class="literal">"" ||</span> <span class="literal">"!?"</span> yields <span class="literal">"!?"</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">&amp;&amp;</span> operator works similarly but the other way around. When the value to its left is something that converts to false, it returns that value, and otherwise it returns the value on its right.</p>
        <p class="indent">Another important property of these two operators is that the part to their right is evaluated only when necessary. In the case of <span class="literal">true || X</span>, no matter what <span class="literal">X</span> is—even if it’s a piece of program that does something <em>terrible</em>—the result will be true, and <span class="literal">X</span> is never evaluated. The same goes for <span class="literal">false &amp;&amp; X</span>, which is false and will ignore <span class="literal">X</span>. This is called <em>short-circuit evaluation</em>.</p>
        <p class="indent">The conditional operator works in a similar way. Of the second and third values, only the one that is selected is evaluated.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev13">Summary</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We looked at four types of JavaScript values in this chapter: numbers, strings, Booleans, and undefined values.</p>
        <p class="indent">Such values are created by typing in their name (<span class="literal">true</span>, <span class="literal">null</span>) or value (<span class="literal">13</span>, <span class="literal">"abc"</span>). You can combine and transform values with operators. We saw binary operators for arithmetic (<span class="literal">+</span>, <span class="literal">-</span>, <span class="literal">*</span>, <span class="literal">/</span>, and <span class="literal">%</span>), string concatenation (<span class="literal">+</span>), comparison (<span class="literal">==</span>, <span class="literal">!=</span>, <span class="literal">===</span>, <span class="literal">!==</span>, <span class="literal">&lt;</span>, <span class="literal">&gt;</span>, <span class="literal">&lt;=</span>, <span class="literal">&gt;=</span>), and logic (<span class="literal">&amp;&amp;</span>, <span class="literal">||</span>), as well as several unary operators (<span class="literal">-</span> to negate a number, <span class="literal">!</span> to negate logically, and <span class="literal">typeof</span> to find a value’s type) and a ternary operator (<span class="literal">?:</span>) to pick one of two values based on a third value.</p>
        <p class="indent">This gives you enough information to use JavaScript as a pocket calculator but not much more. The next chapter will start tying these expressions together into basic programs.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"></span></p>
