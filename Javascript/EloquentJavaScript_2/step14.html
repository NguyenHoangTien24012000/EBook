        <p class="intro">When you open a web page in your browser, the browser retrieves the page’s HTML text and parses it, much like the way our parser from <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a> parsed programs. The browser builds up a model of the document’s structure and uses this model to draw the page on the screen.</p>
        <p class="indent">This representation of the document is one of the toys that a JavaScript program has available in its sandbox. It is a data structure that you can read or modify. It acts as a <em>live</em> data structure: when it’s modified, the page on the screen is updated to reflect the changes.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev1">Document Structure</h3>
        <p class="noindent">You can imagine an HTML document as a nested set of boxes. Tags such as <span class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</span> and <span class="literal">&lt;/body&gt;</span> enclose other tags, which in turn contain other tags or text. Here’s the example document from the previous chapter:</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My home page&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;My home page&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a book! Read it<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228"></span>This page has the following structure:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0228-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="420" height="526"></div>
        <p class="indent">The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows this shape. For each box, there is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which boxes and text it contains. This representation is called the <em>Document Object Model</em>, or DOM for short.</p>
        <p class="indent">The global binding <span class="literal">document</span> gives us access to these objects. Its <span class="literal">documentElement</span> property refers to the object representing the <span class="literal">&lt;html&gt;</span> tag. Since every HTML document has a head and a body, it also has <span class="literal">head</span> and <span class="literal">body</span> properties, pointing at those elements.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev2">Trees</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Think back for a moment to the syntax trees from “Parsing” on <a href="ch12.xhtml#page_203">page 203</a>. Their structures are strikingly similar to the structure of a browser’s document. Each <em>node</em> may refer to other nodes, <em>children</em>, which in turn may have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229"></span>their own children. This shape is typical of nested structures where elements can contain subelements that are similar to themselves.</p>
        <p class="indent">We call a data structure a <em>tree</em> when it has a branching structure, has no cycles (a node may not contain itself, directly or indirectly), and has a single, well-defined <em>root</em>. In the case of the DOM, <span class="literal">document.documentElement</span> serves as the root.</p>
        <p class="indent">Trees come up a lot in computer science. In addition to representing recursive structures such as HTML documents or programs, they are often used to maintain sorted sets of data because elements can usually be found or inserted more efficiently in a tree than in a flat array.</p>
        <p class="indent">A typical tree has different kinds of nodes. The syntax tree for the Egg language had identifiers, values, and application nodes. Application nodes may have children, whereas identifiers and values are <em>leaves</em>, or nodes without children.</p>
        <p class="indent">The same goes for the DOM. Nodes for <em>elements</em>, which represent HTML tags, determine the structure of the document. These can have child nodes. An example of such a node is <span class="literal">document.body</span>. Some of these children can be leaf nodes, such as pieces of text or comment nodes.</p>
        <p class="indent">Each DOM node object has a <span class="literal">nodeType</span> property, which contains a code (number) that identifies the type of node. Elements have code 1, which is also defined as the constant property <span class="literal">Node.ELEMENT_NODE</span>. Text nodes, representing a section of text in the document, get code 3 (<span class="literal">Node.TEXT_NODE</span>). Comments have code 8 (<span class="literal">Node.COMMENT_NODE</span>).</p>
        <p class="indent">Another way to visualize our document tree is as follows:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0229-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="453" height="279"></div>
        <p class="indent">The leaves are text nodes, and the arrows indicate parent-child relationships between nodes.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev3">The Standard</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Using cryptic numeric codes to represent node types is not a very JavaScript-like thing to do. Later in this chapter, we’ll see that other parts of the DOM interface also feel cumbersome and alien. The reason for this is that the DOM wasn’t designed for just JavaScript. Rather, it tries to be a language-neutral interface that can be used in other systems as well—not just for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_230"></span>HTML but also for XML, which is a generic data format with an HTML-like syntax.</p>
        <p class="indent">This is unfortunate. Standards are often useful. But in this case, the advantage (cross-language consistency) isn’t all that compelling. Having an interface that is properly integrated with the language you are using will save you more time than having a familiar interface across languages.</p>
        <p class="indent">As an example of this poor integration, consider the <span class="literal">childNodes</span> property that element nodes in the DOM have. This property holds an array-like object, with a <span class="literal">length</span> property and properties labeled by numbers to access the child nodes. But it is an instance of the <span class="literal">NodeList</span> type, not a real array, so it does not have methods such as <span class="literal">slice</span> and <span class="literal">map</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Then there are issues that are simply poor design. For example, there is no way to create a new node and immediately add children or attributes to it. Instead, you have to first create it and then add the children and attributes one by one, using side effects. Code that interacts heavily with the DOM tends to get long, repetitive, and ugly.</p>
        <p class="indent">But these flaws aren’t fatal. Since JavaScript allows us to create our own abstractions, it is possible to design improved ways to express the operations you are performing. Many libraries intended for browser programming come with such tools.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev4">Moving Through the Tree</h3>
        <p class="noindent">DOM nodes contain a wealth of links to other nearby nodes. The following diagram illustrates these:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0230-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="428" height="386"></div>
        <p class="indent">Although the diagram shows only one link of each type, every node has a <span class="literal">parentNode</span> property that points to the node it is part of, if any. Likewise, every element node (node type 1) has a <span class="literal">childNodes</span> property that points to an array-like object holding its children.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231"></span>In theory, you could move anywhere in the tree using just these parent and child links. But JavaScript also gives you access to a number of additional convenience links. The <span class="literal">firstChild</span> and <span class="literal">lastChild</span> properties point to the first and last child elements or have the value <span class="literal">null</span> for nodes without children. Similarly, <span class="literal">previousSibling</span> and <span class="literal">nextSibling</span> point to adjacent nodes, which are nodes with the same parent that appear immediately before or after the node itself. For a first child, <span class="literal">previousSibling</span> will be null, and for a last child, <span class="literal">nextSibling</span> will be null.</p>
        <p class="indent">There’s also the <span class="literal">children</span> property, which is like <span class="literal">childNodes</span> but contains only element (type 1) children, not other types of child nodes. This can be useful when you aren’t interested in text nodes.</p>
        <p class="indent">When dealing with a nested data structure like this one, recursive functions are often useful. The following function scans a document for text nodes containing a given string and returns <span class="literal">true</span> when it has found one:</p>
        <p class="programs">function talksAbout(node, string) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (node.nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let child of node.childNodes) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (talksAbout(child, string)) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} else if (node.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return node.nodeValue.indexOf(string) &gt; -1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br><br>console.log(talksAbout(document.body, "book"));<br>// → true</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">nodeValue</span> property of a text node holds the string of text that it represents.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev5">Finding Elements</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Navigating these links among parents, children, and siblings is often useful. But if we want to find a specific node in the document, reaching it by starting at <span class="literal">document.body</span> and following a fixed path of properties is a bad idea. Doing so bakes assumptions into our program about the precise structure of the document—a structure you might want to change later. Another complicating factor is that text nodes are created even for the whitespace between nodes. The example document’s <span class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</span> tag does not have just three <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232"></span>children (<span class="literal">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and two <span class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements) but actually has seven: those three, plus the spaces before, after, and between them.</p>
        <p class="indent">So if we want to get the <span class="literal">href</span> attribute of the link in that document, we don’t want to say something like “Get the second child of the sixth child of the document body.” It’d be better if we could say “Get the first link in the document.” And we can.</p>
        <p class="programs">let link = document.body.getElementsByTagName("a")[0];<br>console.log(link.href);</p>
        <p class="indent">All element nodes have a <span class="literal">getElementsByTagName</span> method, which collects all elements with the given tag name that are descendants (direct or indirect children) of that node and returns them as an array-like object.</p>
        <p class="indent">To find a specific <em>single</em> node, you can give it an <span class="literal">id</span> attribute and use <span class="literal">document.getElementById</span> instead.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p&gt;My ostrich Gertrude:&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id="gertrude" src="https://learning.oreilly.comimg/ostrich.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let ostrich = document.getElementById("gertrude");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(ostrich.src);<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">A third, similar method is <span class="literal">getElementsByClassName</span>, which, like <span class="literal">getElementsByTagName</span>, searches through the contents of an element node and retrieves all elements that have the given string in their <span class="literal">class</span> attribute.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev6">Changing the Document</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Almost everything about the DOM data structure can be changed. The shape of the document tree can be modified by changing parent-child relationships. Nodes have a <span class="literal">remove</span> method to remove them from their current parent node. To add a child node to an element node, we can use <span class="literal">appendChild</span>, which puts it at the end of the list of children, or <span class="literal">insertBefore</span>, which inserts the node given as the first argument before the node given as the second argument.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p&gt;One&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Two&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Three&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let paragraphs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]);<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233"></span>A node can exist in the document in only one place. Thus, inserting paragraph <em>Three</em> in front of paragraph <em>One</em> will first remove it from the end of the document and then insert it at the front, resulting in <em>Three</em>/<em>One</em>/<em>Two</em>. All operations that insert a node somewhere will, as a side effect, cause it to be removed from its current position (if it has one).</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">replaceChild</span> method is used to replace a child node with another one. It takes as arguments two nodes: a new node and the node to be replaced. The replaced node must be a child of the element the method is called on. Note that both <span class="literal">replaceChild</span> and <span class="literal">insertBefore</span> expect the <em>new</em> node as their first argument.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev7">Creating Nodes</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Say we want to write a script that replaces all images (<span class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</span> tags) in the document with the text held in their <span class="literal">alt</span> attributes, which specifies an alternative textual representation of the image.</p>
        <p class="indent">This involves not only removing the images but adding a new text node to replace them. Text nodes are created with the <span class="literal">document.createTextNode</span> method.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;img src="https://learning.oreilly.comimg/cat.png" alt="Cat"&gt; in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="https://learning.oreilly.comimg/hat.png" alt="Hat"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="replaceImages()"&gt;Replace&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;function replaceImages() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let images = document.body.getElementsByTagName("img");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = images.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let image = images[i];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (image.alt) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let text = document.createTextNode(image.alt);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">Given a string, <span class="literal">createTextNode</span> gives us a text node that we can insert into the document to make it show up on the screen.</p>
        <p class="indent">The loop that goes over the images starts at the end of the list. This is necessary because the node list returned by <span class="literal">getElementsByTagName</span> (or a property like <span class="literal">childNodes</span>) is <em>live</em>. That is, it is updated as the document changes. If we started from the front, removing the first image would cause the list to lose its first element so that the second time the loop repeats, where <span class="literal">i</span> is 1, it would stop because the length of the collection is now also 1.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234"></span>If you want a <em>solid</em> collection of nodes, as opposed to a live one, you can convert the collection to a real array by calling <span class="literal">Array.from</span>.</p>
        <p class="programs">let arrayish = {0: "one", 1: "two", length: 2};<br>let array = Array.from(arrayish);<br>console.log(array.map(s =&gt; s.toUpperCase()));<br>// → ["ONE", "TWO"]</p>
        <p class="indent">To create element nodes, you can use the <span class="literal">document.createElement</span> method. This method takes a tag name and returns a new empty node of the given type.</p>
        <p class="indent">The following example defines a utility <span class="literal">elt</span>, which creates an element node and treats the rest of its arguments as children to that node. This function is then used to add an attribution to a quote.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;blockquote id="quote"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;No book can ever be finished. While working on it we learn<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;just enough to find it immature the moment we turn away<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;from it.<br>&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;function elt(type, ...children) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let node = document.createElement(type);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let child of children) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (typeof child != "string") node.appendChild(child);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else node.appendChild(document.createTextNode(child));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return node;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById("quote").appendChild(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elt("footer", "--",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elt("strong", "Karl Popper"),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", preface to the second edition of ",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elt("em", "The Open Society and Its Enemies"),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", 1950"));<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">This is what the resulting document looks like:</p>
        <p class="bq1">No book can ever be finished. While working no it we learn just enough to find it immature the moment we turn away from it.</p>
        <p class="bq1">—<strong>Karl Popper</strong>, preface to the second editon of <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>, 1950</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev8"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"></span>Attributes</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Some element attributes, such as <span class="literal">href</span> for links, can be accessed through a property of the same name on the element’s DOM object. This is the case for most commonly used standard attributes.</p>
        <p class="indent">But HTML allows you to set any attribute you want on nodes. This can be useful because it allows you to store extra information in a document. If you make up your own attribute names, though, such attributes will not be present as properties on the element’s node. Instead, you have to use the <span class="literal">getAttribute</span> and <span class="literal">setAttribute</span> methods to work with them.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p data-classified="secret"&gt;The launch code is 00000000.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p data-classified="unclassified"&gt;I have two feet.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let paras = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let para of Array.from(paras)) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (para.getAttribute("data-classified") == "secret") {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;para.remove();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">It is recommended to prefix the names of such made-up attributes with <span class="literal">data-</span> to ensure they do not conflict with any other attributes.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a commonly used attribute, <span class="literal">class</span>, which is a keyword in the JavaScript language. For historical reasons—some old JavaScript implementations could not handle property names that matched keywords—the property used to access this attribute is called <span class="literal">className</span>. You can also access it under its real name, <span class="literal">"class"</span>, by using the <span class="literal">getAttribute</span> and <span class="literal">setAttribute</span> methods.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev9">Layout</h3>
        <p class="noindent">You may have noticed that different types of elements are laid out differently. Some, such as paragraphs (<span class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</span>) or headings (<span class="literal">&lt;h1&gt;</span>), take up the whole width of the document and are rendered on separate lines. These are called <em>block</em> elements. Others, such as links (<span class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</span>) or the <span class="literal">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, are rendered on the same line with their surrounding text. Such elements are called <em>inline</em> elements.</p>
        <p class="indent">For any given document, browsers are able to compute a layout, which gives each element a size and position based on its type and content. This layout is then used to actually draw the document.</p>
        <p class="indent">The size and position of an element can be accessed from JavaScript. The <span class="literal">offsetWidth</span> and <span class="literal">offsetHeight</span> properties give you the space the element takes up in <em>pixels</em>. A pixel is the basic unit of measurement in the browser. It traditionally corresponds to the smallest dot that the screen can draw, but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236"></span>on modern displays, which can draw <em>very</em> small dots, that may no longer be the case, and a browser pixel may span multiple display dots.</p>
        <p class="indent">Similarly, <span class="literal">clientWidth</span> and <span class="literal">clientHeight</span> give you the size of the space <em>inside</em> the element, ignoring border width.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p style="border: 3px solid red"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm boxed in<br>&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let para = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("clientHeight:", para.clientHeight);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("offsetHeight:", para.offsetHeight);<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">Giving a paragraph a border causes a rectangle to be drawn around it.</p>
        <div class="image1"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0236-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="504" height="28"></div>
        <p class="indent">The most effective way to find the precise position of an element on the screen is the <span class="literal">getBoundingClientRect</span> method. It returns an object with <span class="literal">top</span>, <span class="literal">bottom</span>, <span class="literal">left</span>, and <span class="literal">right</span> properties, indicating the pixel positions of the sides of the element relative to the top left of the screen. If you want them relative to the whole document, you must add the current scroll position, which you can find in the <span class="literal">pageXOffset</span> and <span class="literal">pageYOffset</span> bindings.</p>
        <p class="indent">Laying out a document can be quite a lot of work. In the interest of speed, browser engines do not immediately re-layout a document every time you change it but wait as long as they can. When a JavaScript program that changed the document finishes running, the browser will have to compute a new layout to draw the changed document to the screen. When a program <em>asks</em> for the position or size of something by reading properties such as <span class="literal">offsetHeight</span> or calling <span class="literal">getBoundingClientRect</span>, providing correct information also requires computing a layout.</p>
        <p class="indent">A program that repeatedly alternates between reading DOM layout information and changing the DOM forces a lot of layout computations to happen and will consequently run very slowly. The following code is an example of this. It contains two different programs that build up a line of <em>X</em> characters 2,000 pixels wide and measures the time each one takes.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="one"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="two"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;function time(name, action) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let start = Date.now(); // Current time in milliseconds<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(name, "took", Date.now() - start, "ms");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time("naive", () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let target = document.getElementById("one");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while (target.offsetWidth &lt; 2000) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// → naive took 32 ms<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time("clever", function() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let target = document.getElementById("two");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.firstChild.nodeValue = "X".repeat(total);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; });<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; // → clever took 1 ms<br> &lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev10"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_237"></span>Styling</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We have seen that different HTML elements are drawn differently. Some are displayed as blocks, others inline. Some add styling—<span class="literal">&lt;strong&gt;</span> makes its content bold, and <span class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</span> makes it blue and underlines it.</p>
        <p class="indent">The way an <span class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag shows an image or an <span class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</span> tag causes a link to be followed when it is clicked is strongly tied to the element type. But we can change the styling associated with an element, such as the text color or underline. Here is an example that uses the <span class="literal">style</span> property:</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="."&gt;Normal link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="." style="color: green"&gt;Green link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">The second link will be green instead of the default link color.</p>
        <div class="image1"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0236-02.jpg" alt="Image" width="98" height="58"></div>
        <p class="indent">A style attribute may contain one or more <em>declarations</em>, which are a property (such as <span class="literal">color</span>) followed by a colon and a value (such as <span class="literal">green</span>). When there is more than one declaration, they must be separated by semicolons, as in <span class="literal">"color: red; border: none"</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">A lot of aspects of the document can be influenced by styling. For example, the <span class="literal">display</span> property controls whether an element is displayed as a block or an inline element.</p>
        <p class="programs">This text is displayed &lt;strong&gt;inline&lt;/strong&gt;,<br>&lt;strong style="display: block"&gt;as a block&lt;/strong&gt;, and<br>&lt;strong style="display: none"&gt;not at all&lt;/strong&gt;.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238"></span>The <span class="literal">block</span> tag will end up on its own line since block elements are not displayed inline with the text around them. The last tag is not displayed at all—<span class="literal">display: none</span> prevents an element from showing up on the screen. This is a way to hide elements. It is often preferable to removing them from the document entirely because it makes it easy to reveal them again later.</p>
        <div class="image1"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0238-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="226" height="62"></div>
        <p class="indent">JavaScript code can directly manipulate the style of an element through the element’s <span class="literal">style</span> property. This property holds an object that has properties for all possible style properties. The values of these properties are strings, which we can write to in order to change a particular aspect of the element’s style.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p id="para" style="color: purple"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice text<br>&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let para = document.getElementById("para");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(para.style.color);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;para.style.color = "magenta";<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">There are some style property names that contain hyphens, such as <span class="literal">font-family</span>. Because such property names are awkward to work with in Java-Script (you’d have to say <span class="literal">style["font-family"]</span>), the property names in the <span class="literal">style</span> object for such properties have their hyphens removed and the letters after them capitalized (<span class="literal">style.fontFamily</span>).</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev11">Cascading Styles</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The styling system for HTML is called CSS, for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. A <em>style sheet</em> is a set of rules for how to style elements in a document. It can be given inside a <span class="literal">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag.</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;style&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;strong {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-style: italic;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: gray;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&lt;/style&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;strong text&lt;/strong&gt; is italic and gray.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">The <em>cascading</em> in the name refers to the fact that multiple such rules are combined to produce the final style for an element. In the example, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_239"></span>the default styling for <span class="literal">&lt;strong&gt;</span> tags, which gives them <span class="literal">font-weight: bold</span>, is overlaid by the rule in the <span class="literal">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag, which adds <span class="literal">font-style</span> and <span class="literal">color</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">When multiple rules define a value for the same property, the most recently read rule gets a higher precedence and wins. So if the rule in the <span class="literal">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag included <span class="literal">font-weight: normal</span>, contradicting the default <span class="literal">font-weight</span> rule, the text would be normal, <em>not</em> bold. Styles in a <span class="literal">style</span> attribute applied directly to the node have the highest precedence and always win.</p>
        <p class="indent">It is possible to target things other than tag names in CSS rules. A rule for <span class="literal">.abc</span> applies to all elements with <span class="literal">"abc"</span> in their <span class="literal">class</span> attribute. A rule for <span class="literal">#xyz</span> applies to the element with an <span class="literal">id</span> attribute of <span class="literal">"xyz"</span> (which should be unique within the document).</p>
        <p class="programs">.subtle {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;color: gray;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 80%;<br>}<br>#header {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;background: blue;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;color: white;<br>}<br>/* p elements with id main and with classes a and b */<br>p#main.a.b {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-bottom: 20px;<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">The precedence rule favoring the most recently defined rule applies only when the rules have the same <em>specificity</em>. A rule’s specificity is a measure of how precisely it describes matching elements, determined by the number and kind (tag, class, or ID) of element aspects it requires. For example, a rule that targets <span class="literal">p.a</span> is more specific than rules that target <span class="literal">p</span> or just <span class="literal">.a</span> and would thus take precedence over them.</p>
        <p class="indent">The notation <span class="literal">p &gt; a {...}</span> applies the given styles to all <span class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</span> tags that are direct children of <span class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags. Similarly, <span class="literal">p a {...}</span> applies to all <span class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</span> tags inside <span class="literal">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags, whether they are direct or indirect children.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev12">Query Selectors</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We won’t be using style sheets all that much in this book. Understanding them is helpful when programming in the browser, but they are complicated enough to warrant a separate book.</p>
        <p class="indent">The main reason I introduced <em>selector</em> syntax—the notation used in style sheets to determine which elements a set of styles apply to—is that we can use this same mini-language as an effective way to find DOM elements.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">querySelectorAll</span> method, which is defined both on the <span class="literal">document</span> object and on element nodes, takes a selector string and returns a <span class="literal">NodeList</span> containing all the elements that it matches.</p>
        <p class="programs"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_240"></span>&lt;p&gt;And if you go chasing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span class="animal"&gt;rabbits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;And you know you're going to fall&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Tell 'em a &lt;span class="character"&gt;hookah smoking<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span class="animal"&gt;caterpillar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Has given you the call&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;function count(selector) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(count("p"));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // All &lt;p&gt; elements<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// → 4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(count(".animal"));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Class animal<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// → 2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(count("p .animal")); // Animal inside of &lt;p&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// → 2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(count("p &gt; .animal")); // Direct child of &lt;p&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// → 1<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">Unlike methods such as <span class="literal">getElementsByTagName</span>, the object returned by <span class="literal">querySelectorAll</span> is <em>not</em> live. It won’t change when you change the document. It is still not a real array, though, so you still need to call <span class="literal">Array.from</span> if you want to treat it like one.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">querySelector</span> method (without the <span class="literal">All</span> part) works in a similar way. This one is useful if you want a specific, single element. It will return only the first matching element or null when no element matches.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev13">Positioning and Animating</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The <span class="literal">position</span> style property influences layout in a powerful way. By default it has a value of <span class="literal">static</span>, meaning the element sits in its normal place in the document. When it is set to <span class="literal">relative</span>, the element still takes up space in the document, but now the <span class="literal">top</span> and <span class="literal">left</span> style properties can be used to move it relative to that normal place. When <span class="literal">position</span> is set to <span class="literal">absolute</span>, the element is removed from the normal document flow—that is, it no longer takes up space and may overlap with other elements. Also, its <span class="literal">top</span> and <span class="literal">left</span> properties can be used to absolutely position it relative to the top-left corner of the nearest enclosing element whose <span class="literal">position</span> property isn’t <span class="literal">static</span>, or relative to the document if no such enclosing element exists.</p>
        <p class="indent">We can use this to create an animation. The following document displays a picture of a cat that moves around in an ellipse:</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="https://learning.oreilly.comimg/cat.png" style="position: relative"&gt;<br>&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let cat = document.querySelector("img");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let angle = Math.PI / 2;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;function animate(time, lastTime) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (lastTime != null) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px";<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requestAnimationFrame(newTime =&gt; animate(newTime, time));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;requestAnimationFrame(animate);<br>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_241"></span>The gray arrow shows the path along which the image moves.</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0241-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="525" height="155"></div>
        <p class="indent">Our picture is centered on the page and given a <span class="literal">position</span> of <span class="literal">relative</span>. We’ll repeatedly update that picture’s <span class="literal">top</span> and <span class="literal">left</span> styles to move it.</p>
        <p class="indent">The script uses <span class="literal">requestAnimationFrame</span> to schedule the <span class="literal">animate</span> function to run whenever the browser is ready to repaint the screen. The <span class="literal">animate</span> function itself again calls <span class="literal">requestAnimationFrame</span> to schedule the next update. When the browser window (or tab) is active, this will cause updates to happen at a rate of about 60 per second, which tends to produce a good-looking animation.</p>
        <p class="indent">If we just updated the DOM in a loop, the page would freeze, and nothing would show up on the screen. Browsers do not update their display while a JavaScript program is running, nor do they allow any interaction with the page. This is why we need <span class="literal">requestAnimationFrame</span>—it lets the browser know that we are done for now, and it can go ahead and do the things that browsers do, such as updating the screen and responding to user actions.</p>
        <p class="indent">The animation function is passed the current time as an argument. To ensure that the motion of the cat per millisecond is stable, it bases the speed at which the angle changes on the difference between the current time and the last time the function ran. If it just moved the angle by a fixed amount per step, the motion would stutter if, for example, another heavy task running on the same computer were to prevent the function from running for a fraction of a second.</p>
        <p class="indent">Moving in circles is done using the trigonometry functions <span class="literal">Math.cos</span> and <span class="literal">Math.sin</span>. For those who aren’t familiar with these, I’ll briefly introduce them since we will occasionally use them in this book.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242"></span><span class="literal">Math.cos</span> and <span class="literal">Math.sin</span> are useful for finding points that lie on a circle around point (0,0) with a radius of one. Both functions interpret their argument as the position on this circle, with zero denoting the point on the far right of the circle, going clockwise until 2<em>π</em> (about 6.28) has taken us around the whole circle. <span class="literal">Math.cos</span> tells you the x-coordinate of the point that corresponds to the given position, and <span class="literal">Math.sin</span> yields the y-coordinate. Positions (or angles) greater than 2<em>π</em> or less than 0 are valid—the rotation repeats so that <em>a</em> + 2<em>π</em> refers to the same angle as <em>a</em>.</p>
        <p class="indent">This unit for measuring angles is called radians—a full circle is 2<em>π</em> radians, similar to how it is 360 degrees when measuring in degrees. The constant <em>π</em> is available as <span class="literal">Math.PI</span> in JavaScript.</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0242-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="319" height="253"></div>
        <p class="indent">The cat animation code keeps a counter, <span class="literal">angle</span>, for the current angle of the animation and increments it every time the <span class="literal">animate</span> function is called. It can then use this angle to compute the current position of the image element. The <span class="literal">top</span> style is computed with <span class="literal">Math.sin</span> and multiplied by 20, which is the vertical radius of our ellipse. The <span class="literal">left</span> style is based on <span class="literal">Math.cos</span> and multiplied by 200 so that the ellipse is much wider than it is high.</p>
        <p class="indent">Note that styles usually need <em>units</em>. In this case, we have to append <span class="literal">"px"</span> to the number to tell the browser that we are counting in pixels (as opposed to centimeters, “ems,” or other units). This is easy to forget. Using numbers without units will result in your style being ignored—unless the number is 0, which always means the same thing, regardless of its unit.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev14">Summary</h3>
        <p class="noindent">JavaScript programs may inspect and interfere with the document that the browser is displaying through a data structure called the DOM. This data structure represents the browser’s model of the document, and a JavaScript program can modify it to change the visible document.</p>
        <p class="indent">The DOM is organized like a tree, in which elements are arranged hierarchically according to the structure of the document. The objects representing elements have properties such as <span class="literal">parentNode</span> and <span class="literal">childNodes</span>, which can be used to navigate through this tree.</p>
        <p class="indent">The way a document is displayed can be influenced by <em>styling</em>, both by attaching styles to nodes directly and by defining rules that match certain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_243"></span>nodes. There are many different style properties, such as <span class="literal">color</span> or <span class="literal">display</span>. JavaScript code can manipulate an element’s style directly through its <span class="literal">style</span> property.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev15">Exercises</h3>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch14lev16"><em>Build a Table</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">An HTML table is built with the following tag structure:</p>
        <p class="programs">&lt;table&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;th&gt;name&lt;/th&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;th&gt;height&lt;/th&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;th&gt;place&lt;/th&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;Kilimanjaro&lt;/td&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;5895&lt;/td&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;Tanzania&lt;/td&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</p>
        <p class="indent">For each <em>row</em>, the <span class="literal">&lt;table&gt;</span> tag contains a <span class="literal">&lt;tr&gt;</span> tag. Inside of these <span class="literal">&lt;tr&gt;</span> tags, we can put cell elements: either heading cells (<span class="literal">&lt;th&gt;</span>) or regular cells (<span class="literal">&lt;td&gt;</span>).</p>
        <p class="indent">Given a data set of mountains, an array of objects with <span class="literal">name</span>, <span class="literal">height</span>, and <span class="literal">place</span> properties, generate the DOM structure for a table that enumerates the objects. It should have one column per key and one row per object, plus a header row with <span class="literal">&lt;th&gt;</span> elements at the top, listing the column names.</p>
        <p class="indent">Write this so that the columns are automatically derived from the objects, by taking the property names of the first object in the data.</p>
        <p class="indent">Add the resulting table to the element with an <span class="literal">id</span> attribute of <span class="literal">"mountains"</span> so that it becomes visible in the document.</p>
        <p class="indent">Once you have this working, right-align cells that contain number values by setting their <span class="literal">style.textAlign</span> property to <span class="literal">"right"</span>.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch14lev17"><em>Elements by Tag Name</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The <span class="literal">document.getElementsByTagName</span> method returns all child elements with a given tag name. Implement your own version of this as a function that takes a node and a string (the tag name) as arguments and returns an array containing all descendant element nodes with the given tag name.</p>
        <p class="indent">To find the tag name of an element, use its <span class="literal">nodeName</span> property. But note that this will return the tag name in all uppercase. Use the <span class="literal">toLowerCase</span> or <span class="literal">toUpperCase</span> string methods to compensate for this.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch14lev18"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244"></span><em>The Cat’s Hat</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Extend the cat animation defined in “Positioning and Animating” on <a href="ch14.xhtml#page_240">page 240</a> so that both the cat and his hat (<span class="literal">&lt;img src="https://learning.oreilly.comimg/hat.png"&gt;</span>) orbit at opposite sides of the ellipse.</p>
        <p class="indent">Or make the hat circle around the cat. Or alter the animation in some other interesting way.</p>
        <p class="indent">To make positioning multiple objects easier, it is probably a good idea to switch to absolute positioning. This means that <span class="literal">top</span> and <span class="literal">left</span> are counted relative to the top left of the document. To avoid using negative coordinates, which would cause the image to move outside of the visible page, you can add a fixed number of pixels to the position values.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_245"></span></p>
