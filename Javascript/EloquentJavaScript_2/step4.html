        <p class="intro">Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. <em>Objects</em> allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more complex structures.</p>
        <p class="indent">The programs we have built so far have been limited by the fact that they were operating only on simple data types. This chapter will introduce basic data structures. By the end of it, you’ll know enough to start writing useful programs.</p>
        <p class="indent">The chapter will work through a more or less realistic programming example, introducing concepts as they apply to the problem at hand. The example code will often build on functions and bindings that were introduced earlier in the text.</p>
        <p class="indent">The online coding sandbox for the book (<em><a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/code">https://eloquentjavascript.net/code</a></em>) provides a way to run code in the context of a specific chapter. If you decide to work through the examples in another environment, be sure to first download the full code for this chapter from the sandbox page.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60"></span>The Weresquirrel</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Every now and then, usually between 8 <small>PM</small> and 10 <small>PM</small>, Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.</p>
        <p class="indent">On one hand, Jacques is quite glad that he doesn’t have classic lycanthropy. Turning into a squirrel does cause fewer problems than turning into a wolf. Instead of having to worry about accidentally eating the neighbor (<em>that</em> would be awkward), he worries about being eaten by the neighbor’s cat. After two occasions where he woke up on a precariously thin branch in the crown of an oak, naked and disoriented, he has taken to locking the doors and windows of his room at night and putting a few walnuts on the floor to keep himself busy.</p>
        <p class="indent">That takes care of the cat and tree problems. But Jacques would prefer to get rid of his condition entirely. The irregular occurrences of the transformation make him suspect that they might be triggered by something. For a while, he believed that it happened only on days when he had been near oak trees. But avoiding oak trees did not stop the problem.</p>
        <p class="indent">Switching to a more scientific approach, Jacques has started keeping a daily log of everything he does on a given day and whether he changed form. With this data he hopes to narrow down the conditions that trigger the transformations.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first thing he needs is a data structure to store this information.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev2">Data Sets</h3>
        <p class="noindent">To work with a chunk of digital data, we’ll first have to find a way to represent it in our machine’s memory. Say, for example, that we want to represent a collection of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.</p>
        <p class="indent">We could get creative with strings—after all, strings can have any length, so we can put a lot of data into them—and use <span class="literal">"2 3 5 7 11"</span> as our representation. But this is awkward. You’d have to somehow extract the digits and convert them back to numbers to access them.</p>
        <p class="indent">Fortunately, JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an <em>array</em> and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.</p>
        <p class="programs">let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];<br>console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);<br>// → 5<br>console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);<br>// → 2<br>console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);<br>// → 3</p>
        <p class="indent">The notation for getting at the elements inside an array also uses square brackets. A pair of square brackets immediately after an expression, with another expression inside of them, will look up the element in the left-hand <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61"></span>expression that corresponds to the <em>index</em> given by the expression in the brackets.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first index of an array is zero, not one. So the first element is retrieved with <span class="literal">listOfNumbers[0]</span>. Zero-based counting has a long tradition in technology and in certain ways makes a lot of sense, but it takes some getting used to. Think of the index as the amount of items to skip, counting from the start of the array.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev3">Properties</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We’ve seen a few suspicious-looking expressions like <span class="literal">myString.length</span> (to get the length of a string) and <span class="literal">Math.max</span> (the maximum function) in past chapters. These are expressions that access a <em>property</em> of some value. In the first case, we access the <span class="literal">length</span> property of the value in <span class="literal">myString</span>. In the second, we access the property named <span class="literal">max</span> in the <span class="literal">Math</span> object (which is a collection of mathematics-related constants and functions).</p>
        <p class="indent">Almost all JavaScript values have properties. The exceptions are <span class="literal">null</span> and <span class="literal">undefined</span>. If you try to access a property on one of these nonvalues, you get an error.</p>
        <p class="programs">null.length;<br>// → TypeError: null has no properties</p>
        <p class="indent">The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. Both <span class="literal">value.x</span> and <span class="literal">value[x]</span> access a property on <span class="literal">value</span>—but not necessarily the same property. The difference is in how <span class="literal">x</span> is interpreted. When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is <em>evaluated</em> to get the property name. Whereas <span class="literal">value.x</span> fetches the property of <span class="literal">value</span> named “x,” <span class="literal">value[x]</span> tries to evaluate the expression <span class="literal">x</span> and uses the result, converted to a string, as the property name.</p>
        <p class="indent">So if you know that the property you are interested in is called <em>color</em>, you say <span class="literal">value.color</span>. If you want to extract the property named by the value held in the binding <span class="literal">i</span>, you say <span class="literal">value[i]</span>. Property names are strings. They can be any string, but the dot notation works only with names that look like valid binding names. So if you want to access a property named <em>2</em> or <em>John Doe</em>, you must use square brackets: <span class="literal">value[2]</span> or <span class="literal">value["John Doe"]</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">The elements in an array are stored as the array’s properties, using numbers as property names. Because you can’t use the dot notation with numbers and usually want to use a binding that holds the index anyway, you have to use the bracket notation to get at them.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">length</span> property of an array tells us how many elements it has. This property name is a valid binding name, and we know its name in advance, so to find the length of an array, you typically write <span class="literal">array.length</span> because that’s easier to write than <span class="literal">array["length"]</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62"></span>Methods</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Both string and array objects contain, in addition to the <span class="literal">length</span> property, a number of properties that hold function values.</p>
        <p class="programs">let doh = "Doh";<br>console.log(typeof doh.toUpperCase);<br>// → function<br>console.log(doh.toUpperCase());<br>// → DOH</p>
        <p class="indent">Every string has a <span class="literal">toUpperCase</span> property. When called, it will return a copy of the string in which all letters have been converted to uppercase. There is also <span class="literal">toLowerCase</span>, going the other way.</p>
        <p class="indent">Interestingly, even though the call to <span class="literal">toUpperCase</span> does not pass any arguments, the function somehow has access to the string <span class="literal">"Doh"</span>, the value whose property we called. How this works is described in “Methods” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_98">page 98</a>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Properties that contain functions are generally called <em>methods</em> of the value they belong to, as in “<span class="literal">toUpperCase</span> is a method of a string.”</p>
        <p class="indent">This example demonstrates two methods you can use to manipulate arrays:</p>
        <p class="programs">let sequence = [1, 2, 3];<br>sequence.push(4);<br>sequence.push(5);<br>console.log(sequence);<br>// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>console.log(sequence.pop());<br>// → 5<br>console.log(sequence);<br>// → [1, 2, 3, 4]</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">push</span> method adds values to the end of an array, and the <span class="literal">pop</span> method does the opposite, removing the last value in the array and returning it.</p>
        <p class="indent">These somewhat silly names are the traditional terms for operations on a <em>stack</em>. A stack, in programming, is a data structure that allows you to push values into it and pop them out again in the opposite order so that the thing that was added last is removed first. These are common in programming—you might remember the function call stack from “The Call Stack” on <a href="ch03.xhtml#page_46">page 46</a>, which is an instance of the same idea.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev5">Objects</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Back to the weresquirrel. A set of daily log entries can be represented as an array. But the entries do not consist of just a number or a string—each entry needs to store a list of activities and a Boolean value that indicates whether Jacques turned into a squirrel or not. Ideally, we would like to group these <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63"></span>together into a single value and then put those grouped values into an array of log entries.</p>
        <p class="indent">Values of the type <em>object</em> are arbitrary collections of properties. One way to create an object is by using braces as an expression.</p>
        <p class="programs">let day1 = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; squirrel: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]<br>};<br>console.log(day1.squirrel);<br>// → false<br>console.log(day1.wolf);<br>// → undefined<br>day1.wolf = false;<br>console.log(day1.wolf);<br>// → false</p>
        <p class="indent">Inside the braces, there is a list of properties separated by commas. Each property has a name followed by a colon and a value. When an object is written over multiple lines, indenting it like in the example helps with readability. Properties whose names aren’t valid binding names or valid numbers have to be quoted.</p>
        <p class="programs">let descriptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; work: "Went to work",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "touched tree": "Touched a tree"<br>};</p>
        <p class="indent">This means that braces have <em>two</em> meanings in JavaScript. At the start of a statement, they start a block of statements. In any other position, they describe an object. Fortunately, it is rarely useful to start a statement with an object in braces, so the ambiguity between these two is not much of a problem.</p>
        <p class="indent">Reading a property that doesn’t exist will give you the value <span class="literal">undefined</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">It is possible to assign a value to a property expression with the <span class="literal">=</span> operator. This will replace the property’s value if it already existed or create a new property on the object if it didn’t.</p>
        <p class="indent">To briefly return to our tentacle model of bindings—property bindings are similar. They <em>grasp</em> values, but other bindings and properties might be holding onto those same values. You may think of objects as octopuses with any number of tentacles, each of which has a name tattooed on it.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">delete</span> operator cuts off a tentacle from such an octopus. It is a unary operator that, when applied to an object property, will remove the named property from the object. This is not a common thing to do, but it is possible.</p>
        <p class="programs">let anObject = {left: 1, right: 2};<br>console.log(anObject.left);<br>// → 1<br>delete anObject.left;<br>console.log(anObject.left);<br>// → undefined<br>console.log("left" in anObject);<br>// → false<br>console.log("right" in anObject);<br>// → true</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_64"></span>The binary <span class="literal">in</span> operator, when applied to a string and an object, tells you whether that object has a property with that name. The difference between setting a property to <span class="literal">undefined</span> and actually deleting it is that, in the first case, the object still <em>has</em> the property (it just doesn’t have a very interesting value), whereas in the second case the property is no longer present and <span class="literal">in</span> will return <span class="literal">false</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">To find out what properties an object has, you can use the <span class="literal">Object.keys</span> function. You give it an object, and it returns an array of strings—the object’s property names.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(Object.keys({x: 0, y: 0, z: 2}));<br>// → ["x", "y", "z"]</p>
        <p class="indent">There’s an <span class="literal">Object.assign</span> function that copies all properties from one object into another.</p>
        <p class="programs">let objectA = {a: 1, b: 2};<br>Object.assign(objectA, {b: 3, c: 4});<br>console.log(objectA);<br>// → {a: 1, b: 3, c: 4}</p>
        <p class="indent">Arrays, then, are just a kind of object specialized for storing sequences of things. If you evaluate <span class="literal">typeof []</span>, it produces <span class="literal">"object"</span>. You can see them as long, flat octopuses with all their tentacles in a neat row, labeled with numbers.</p>
        <p class="indent">We will represent the journal that Jacques keeps as an array of objects.</p>
        <p class="programs">let journal = [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; {events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "running", "television"],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squirrel: false},<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; {events: ["work", "ice cream", "cauliflower",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "lasagna", "touched tree", "brushed teeth"],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squirrel: false},<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; {events: ["weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "beer"],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squirrel: true},<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; /* and so on... */<br>];</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65"></span>Mutability</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We will get to actual programming <em>real</em> soon now. First there’s one more piece of theory to understand.</p>
        <p class="indent">We saw that object values can be modified. The types of values discussed in earlier chapters, such as numbers, strings, and Booleans, are all <em>immutable</em>—it is impossible to change values of those types. You can combine them and derive new values from them, but when you take a specific string value, that value will always remain the same. The text inside it cannot be changed. If you have a string that contains <span class="literal">"cat"</span>, it is not possible for other code to change a character in your string to make it spell <span class="literal">"rat"</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Objects work differently. You <em>can</em> change their properties, causing a single object value to have different content at different times.</p>
        <p class="indent">When we have two numbers, 120 and 120, we can consider them precisely the same number, whether or not they refer to the same physical bits. With objects, there is a difference between having two references to the same object and having two different objects that contain the same properties. Consider the following code:</p>
        <p class="programs">let object1 = {value: 10};<br>let object2 = object1;<br>let object3 = {value: 10};<br><br>console.log(object1 == object2);<br>// → true<br>console.log(object1 == object3);<br>// → false<br><br>object1.value = 15;<br>console.log(object2.value);<br>// → 15<br>console.log(object3.value);<br>// → 10</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">object1</span> and <span class="literal">object2</span> bindings grasp the <em>same</em> object, which is why changing <span class="literal">object1</span> also changes the value of <span class="literal">object2</span>. They are said to have the same <em>identity</em>. The binding <span class="literal">object3</span> points to a different object, which initially contains the same properties as <span class="literal">object1</span> but lives a separate life.</p>
        <p class="indent">Bindings can also be changeable or constant, but this is separate from the way their values behave. Even though number values don’t change, you can use a <span class="literal">let</span> binding to keep track of a changing number by changing the value the binding points at. Similarly, though a <span class="literal">const</span> binding to an object can itself not be changed and will continue to point at the same object, the <em>contents</em> of that object might change.</p>
        <p class="programs">const score = {visitors: 0, home: 0};<br>// This is okay<br>score.visitors = 1;<br>// This isn't allowed<br>score = {visitors: 1, home: 1};</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66"></span>When you compare objects with JavaScript’s <span class="literal">==</span> operator, it compares by identity: it will produce <span class="literal">true</span> only if both objects are precisely the same value. Comparing different objects will return <span class="literal">false</span>, even if they have identical properties. There is no “deep” comparison operation built into JavaScript, which compares objects by contents, but it is possible to write it yourself (which is one of the exercises at the end of this chapter).</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev7">The Lycanthrope’s Log</h3>
        <p class="noindent">So, Jacques starts up his JavaScript interpreter and sets up the environment he needs to keep his journal.</p>
        <p class="programs">let journal = [];<br><br>function addEntry(events, squirrel) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;journal.push({events, squirrel});<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">Note that the object added to the journal looks a little odd. Instead of declaring properties like <span class="literal">events: events</span>, it just gives a property name. This is shorthand that means the same thing—if a property name in brace notation isn’t followed by a value, its value is taken from the binding with the same name.</p>
        <p class="indent">So then, every evening at 10 <small>PM</small>—or sometimes the next morning, after climbing down from the top shelf of his bookcase—Jacques records the day.</p>
        <p class="programs">addEntry(["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"television"], false);<br>addEntry(["work", "ice cream", "cauliflower", "lasagna",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"touched tree", "brushed teeth"], false);<br>addEntry(["weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"beer"], true);</p>
        <p class="indent">Once he has enough data points, he intends to use statistics to find out which of these events may be related to the squirrelifications.</p>
        <p class="indent"><em>Correlation</em> is a measure of dependence between statistical variables. A statistical variable is not quite the same as a programming variable. In statistics you typically have a set of <em>measurements</em>, and each variable is measured for every measurement. Correlation between variables is usually expressed as a value that ranges from –1 to 1. Zero correlation means the variables are not related. A correlation of 1 indicates that the two are perfectly related—if you know one, you also know the other. A correlation of –1 also means that the variables are perfectly related but that they are opposites—when one is true, the other is false.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67"></span>To compute the measure of correlation between two Boolean variables, we can use the <em>phi coefficient</em> (<em>ϕ</em>). This is a formula whose input is a frequency table containing the number of times the different combinations of the variables were observed. The output of the formula is a number between –1 and 1 that describes the correlation.</p>
        <p class="indent">We could take the event of eating pizza and put that in a frequency table like this, where each number indicates the amount of times that combination occurred in our measurements:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0067-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="414" height="283"></div>
        <p class="indent">If we call that table <em>n</em>, we can compute <em>ϕ</em> using the following formula:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/equ4_1.jpg" alt="Image" width="431" height="45"></div>
        <p class="indent">(If at this point you’re putting the book down to focus on a terrible flashback to 10th-grade math class—hold on! I do not intend to torture you with endless pages of cryptic notation—it’s just this one formula for now. And even with this one, all we do is turn it into JavaScript.)</p>
        <p class="indent">The notation <em>n</em><sub>01</sub> indicates the number of measurements where the first variable (squirrelness) is false (0) and the second variable (pizza) is true (1). In the pizza table, <em>n</em><sub>01</sub> is 9.</p>
        <p class="indent">The value <em>n</em><sub>1</sub><sub>•</sub> refers to the sum of all measurements where the first variable is true, which is 5 in the example table. Likewise, <em>n</em><sub>•</sub><sub>0</sub> refers to the sum of the measurements where the second variable is false.</p>
        <p class="indent">So for the pizza table, the part above the division line (the dividend) would be 1 × 76 –4 × 9 = 40, and the part below it (the divisor) would be the square root of 5 × 85 × 10 × 80, or <img class="middle" src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/c0067-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="21">. This comes out to <em>ϕ ≈</em> 0.069, which is tiny. Eating pizza does not appear to have influence on the transformations.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev8">Computing Correlation</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We can represent a two-by-two table in JavaScript with a four-element array (<span class="literal">[76, 9, 4, 1]</span>). We could also use other representations, such as an array containing two two-element arrays (<span class="literal">[[76, 9], [4, 1]]</span>) or an object with property names like <span class="literal">"11"</span> and <span class="literal">"01"</span>, but the flat array is simple and makes the expressions that access the table pleasantly short. We’ll interpret the indices <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_68"></span>to the array as two-bit binary numbers, where the leftmost (most significant) digit refers to the squirrel variable and the rightmost (least significant) digit refers to the event variable. For example, the binary number <span class="literal">10</span> refers to the case where Jacques did turn into a squirrel, but the event (say, “pizza”) didn’t occur. This happened four times. And since binary <span class="literal">10</span> is 2 in decimal notation, we will store this number at index 2 of the array.</p>
        <p class="indent">This is the function that computes the <em>ϕ</em> coefficient from such an array:</p>
        <p class="programs">function phi(table) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return (table[3] * table[0] - table[2] * table[1]) /<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Math.sqrt((table[2] + table[3]) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(table[0] + table[1]) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(table[1] + table[3]) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(table[0] + table[2]));<br>}<br><br>console.log(phi([76, 9, 4, 1]));<br>// → 0.068599434</p>
        <p class="indent">This is a direct translation of the <em>ϕ</em> formula into JavaScript. <span class="literal">Math.sqrt</span> is the square root function, as provided by the <span class="literal">Math</span> object in a standard JavaScript environment. We have to add two fields from the table to get fields like <em>n</em><sub>1</sub><sub>•</sub> because the sums of rows or columns are not stored directly in our data structure.</p>
        <p class="indent">Jacques kept his journal for three months. The resulting data set is available in the coding sandbox for this chapter (<em><a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/code#4">https://eloquentjavascript.net/code#4</a></em>), where it is stored in the <span class="literal">JOURNAL</span> binding and in a downloadable file.</p>
        <p class="indent">To extract a two-by-two table for a specific event from the journal, we must loop over all the entries and tally how many times the event occurs in relation to squirrel transformations.</p>
        <p class="programs">function tableFor(event, journal) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let table = [0, 0, 0, 0];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; journal.length; i++) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let entry = journal[i], index = 0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (entry.events.includes(event)) index += 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (entry.squirrel) index += 2;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table[index] += 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return table;<br>}<br><br>console.log(tableFor("pizza", JOURNAL));<br>// → [76, 9, 4, 1]</p>
        <p class="indent">Arrays have an <span class="literal">includes</span> method that checks whether a given value exists in the array. The function uses that to determine whether the event name it is interested in is part of the event list for a given day.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_69"></span>The body of the loop in <span class="literal">tableFor</span> figures out which box in the table each journal entry falls into by checking whether the entry contains the specific event it’s interested in and whether the event happens alongside a squirrel incident. The loop then adds one to the correct box in the table.</p>
        <p class="indent">We now have the tools we need to compute individual correlations. The only step remaining is to find a correlation for every type of event that was recorded and see whether anything stands out.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev9">Array Loops</h3>
        <p class="noindent">In the <span class="literal">tableFor</span> function, there’s a loop like this:</p>
        <p class="programs">for (let i = 0; i &lt; JOURNAL.length; i++) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let entry = JOURNAL[i];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Do something with entry<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">This kind of loop is common in classical JavaScript—going over arrays one element at a time is something that comes up a lot, and to do that you’d run a counter over the length of the array and pick out each element in turn.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a simpler way to write such loops in modern JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="programs">for (let entry of JOURNAL) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`${entry.events.length} events.`);<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">When a <span class="literal">for</span> loop looks like this, with the word <span class="literal">of</span> after a variable definition, it will loop over the elements of the value given after <span class="literal">of</span>. This works not only for arrays but also for strings and some other data structures. We’ll discuss <em>how</em> it works in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev10">The Final Analysis</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We need to compute a correlation for every type of event that occurs in the data set. To do that, we first need to <em>find</em> every type of event.</p>
        <p class="programs">function journalEvents(journal) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let events = [];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let entry of journal) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let event of entry.events) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!events.includes(event)) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events.push(event);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return events;<br>}<br><br>console.log(journalEvents(JOURNAL));<br>// → ["carrot", "exercise", "weekend", "bread", ...]</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70"></span>By going over all the events and adding those that aren’t already in there to the <span class="literal">events</span> array, the function collects every type of event.</p>
        <p class="indent">Using that, we can see all the correlations.</p>
        <p class="programs">for (let event of journalEvents(JOURNAL)) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(event + ":", phi(tableFor(event, JOURNAL)));<br>}<br>// → carrot: 0.0140970969<br>// → exercise: 0.0685994341<br>// → weekend: 0.1371988681<br>// → bread: -0.0757554019<br>// → pudding: -0.0648203724<br>// and so on...</p>
        <p class="indent">Most correlations seem to lie close to zero. Eating carrots, bread, or pudding apparently does not trigger squirrel-lycanthropy. It <em>does</em> seem to occur somewhat more often on weekends. Let’s filter the results to show only correlations greater than 0.1 or less than –0.1.</p>
        <p class="programs">for (let event of journalEvents(JOURNAL)) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let correlation = phi(tableFor(event, JOURNAL));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (correlation &gt; 0.1 || correlation &lt; -0.1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(event + ":", correlation);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br>// → weekend:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.1371988681<br>// → brushed teeth: -0.3805211953<br>// → candy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.1296407447<br>// → work:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.1371988681<br>// → spaghetti:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.2425356250<br>// → reading:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.1106828054<br>// → peanuts:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.5902679812</p>
        <p class="indent">Aha! There are two factors with a correlation that’s clearly stronger than the others. Eating peanuts has a strong positive effect on the chance of turning into a squirrel, whereas brushing his teeth has a significant negative effect.</p>
        <p class="indent">Interesting. Let’s try something.</p>
        <p class="programs">for (let entry of JOURNAL) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (entry.events.includes("peanuts") &amp;&amp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !entry.events.includes("brushed teeth")) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entry.events.push("peanut teeth");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br>console.log(phi(tableFor("peanut teeth", JOURNAL)));<br>// → 1</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71"></span>That’s a strong result. The phenomenon occurs precisely when Jacques eats peanuts and fails to brush his teeth. If only he weren’t such a slob about dental hygiene, he’d have never even noticed his affliction.</p>
        <p class="indent">Knowing this, Jacques stops eating peanuts altogether and finds that his transformations don’t come back.</p>
        <p class="indent">For a few years, things go great for Jacques. But at some point he loses his job. Because he lives in a nasty country where having no job means having no medical services, he is forced to take employment with a circus where he performs as <em>The Incredible Squirrelman</em>, stuffing his mouth with peanut butter before every show.</p>
        <p class="indent">One day, fed up with this pitiful existence, Jacques fails to change back into his human form, hops through a crack in the circus tent, and vanishes into the forest. He is never seen again.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev11">Further Arrayology</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Before finishing the chapter, I want to introduce you to a few more object-related concepts. I’ll start by introducing some generally useful array methods.</p>
        <p class="indent">We saw <span class="literal">push</span> and <span class="literal">pop</span>, which add and remove elements at the end of an array, in “Methods” on <a href="ch04.xhtml#page_62">page 62</a>. The corresponding methods for adding and removing things at the start of an array are called <span class="literal">unshift</span> and <span class="literal">shift</span>.</p>
        <p class="programs">let todoList = [];<br>function remember(task) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;todoList.push(task);<br>}<br>function getTask() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return todoList.shift();<br>}<br>function rememberUrgently(task) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;todoList.unshift(task);<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">That program manages a queue of tasks. You add tasks to the end of the queue by calling <span class="literal">remember("groceries")</span>, and when you’re ready to do something, you call <span class="literal">getTask()</span> to get (and remove) the front item from the queue. The <span class="literal">rememberUrgently</span> function also adds a task but adds it to the front instead of the back of the queue.</p>
        <p class="indent">To search for a specific value, arrays provide an <span class="literal">indexOf</span> method. The method searches through the array from the start to the end and returns the index at which the requested value was found—or –1 if it wasn’t found. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72"></span>To search from the end instead of the start, there’s a similar method called <span class="literal">lastIndexOf</span>.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log([1, 2, 3, 2, 1].indexOf(2));<br>// → 1<br>console.log([1, 2, 3, 2, 1].lastIndexOf(2));<br>// → 3</p>
        <p class="indent">Both <span class="literal">indexOf</span> and <span class="literal">lastIndexOf</span> take an optional second argument that indicates where to start searching.</p>
        <p class="indent">Another fundamental array method is <span class="literal">slice</span>, which takes start and end indices and returns an array that has only the elements between them. The start index is inclusive, the end index exclusive.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2, 4));<br>// → [2, 3]<br>console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2));<br>// → [2, 3, 4]</p>
        <p class="indent">When the end index is not given, <span class="literal">slice</span> will take all of the elements after the start index. You can also omit the start index to copy the entire array.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">concat</span> method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array, similar to what the <span class="literal">+</span> operator does for strings.</p>
        <p class="indent">The following example shows both <span class="literal">concat</span> and <span class="literal">slice</span> in action. It takes an array and an index, and it returns a new array that is a copy of the original array with the element at the given index removed.</p>
        <p class="programs">function remove(array, index) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return array.slice(0, index)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.concat(array.slice(index + 1));<br>}<br>console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2));<br>// → ["a", "b", "d", "e"]</p>
        <p class="indent">If you pass <span class="literal">concat</span> an argument that is not an array, that value will be added to the new array as if it were a one-element array.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev12">Strings and Their Properties</h3>
        <p class="noindent">We can read properties like <span class="literal">length</span> and <span class="literal">toUpperCase</span> from string values. But if you try to add a new property, it doesn’t stick.</p>
        <p class="programs">let kim = "Kim";<br>kim.age = 88;<br>console.log(kim.age);<br>// → undefined</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73"></span>Values of type string, number, and Boolean are not objects, and though the language doesn’t complain if you try to set new properties on them, it doesn’t actually store those properties. As mentioned earlier, such values are immutable and cannot be changed.</p>
        <p class="indent">But these types do have built-in properties. Every string value has a number of methods. Some very useful ones are <span class="literal">slice</span> and <span class="literal">indexOf</span>, which resemble the array methods of the same name.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log("coconuts".slice(4, 7));<br>// → nut<br>console.log("coconut".indexOf("u"));<br>// → 5</p>
        <p class="indent">One difference is that a string’s <span class="literal">indexOf</span> can search for a string containing more than one character, whereas the corresponding array method looks only for a single element.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log("one two three".indexOf("ee"));<br>// → 11</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">trim</span> method removes whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs, and similar characters) from the start and end of a string.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log("&nbsp;&nbsp; okay \n ".trim());<br>// → okay</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">zeroPad</span> function from the previous chapter also exists as a method. It is called <span class="literal">padStart</span> and takes the desired length and padding character as arguments.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(String(6).padStart(3, "0"));<br>// → 006</p>
        <p class="indent">You can split a string on every occurrence of another string with <span class="literal">split</span> and join it again with <span class="literal">join</span>.</p>
        <p class="programs">let sentence = "Secretarybirds specialize in stomping";<br>let words = sentence.split(" ");<br>console.log(words);<br>// → ["Secretarybirds", "specialize", "in", "stomping"]<br>console.log(words.join(". "));<br>// → Secretarybirds. specialize. in. stomping</p>
        <p class="indent">A string can be repeated with the <span class="literal">repeat</span> method, which creates a new string containing multiple copies of the original string, glued together.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log("LA".repeat(3));<br>// → LALALA</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"></span>We have already seen the string type’s <span class="literal">length</span> property. Accessing the individual characters in a string looks like accessing array elements (with a caveat that we’ll discuss in “Strings and Character Codes” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#page_92">page 92</a>).</p>
        <p class="programs">let string = "abc";<br>console.log(string.length);<br>// → 3<br>console.log(string[1]);<br>// → b</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev13">Rest Parameters</h3>
        <p class="noindent">It can be useful for a function to accept any number of arguments. For example, <span class="literal">Math.max</span> computes the maximum of <em>all</em> the arguments it is given.</p>
        <p class="indent">To write such a function, you put three dots before the function’s last parameter, like this:</p>
        <p class="programs">function max(...numbers) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let result = -Infinity;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let number of numbers) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (number &gt; result) result = number;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>}<br>console.log(max(4, 1, 9, -2));<br>// → 9</p>
        <p class="indent">When such a function is called, the <em>rest parameter</em> is bound to an array containing all further arguments. If there are other parameters before it, their values aren’t part of that array. When, as in <span class="literal">max</span>, it is the only parameter, it will hold all arguments.</p>
        <p class="indent">You can use a similar three-dot notation to <em>call</em> a function with an array of arguments.</p>
        <p class="programs">let numbers = [5, 1, 7];<br>console.log(max(...numbers));<br>// → 7</p>
        <p class="indent">This “spreads” out the array into the function call, passing its elements as separate arguments. It is possible to include an array like that along with other arguments, as in <span class="literal">max(9, ...numbers, 2)</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Square bracket array notation similarly allows the triple-dot operator to spread another array into the new array.</p>
        <p class="programs">let words = ["never", "fully"];<br>console.log(["will", ...words, "understand"]);<br>// → ["will", "never", "fully", "understand"]</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev14"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"></span>The Math Object</h3>
        <p class="noindent">As we’ve seen, <span class="literal">Math</span> is a grab bag of number-related utility functions, such as <span class="literal">Math.max</span> (maximum), <span class="literal">Math.min</span> (minimum), and <span class="literal">Math.sqrt</span> (square root).</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">Math</span> object is used as a container to group a bunch of related functionality. There is only one <span class="literal">Math</span> object, and it is almost never useful as a value. Rather, it provides a <em>namespace</em> so that all these functions and values do not have to be global bindings.</p>
        <p class="indent">Having too many global bindings “pollutes” the namespace. The more names have been taken, the more likely you are to accidentally overwrite the value of some existing binding. For example, it’s not unlikely to want to name something <span class="literal">max</span> in one of your programs. Since JavaScript’s built-in <span class="literal">max</span> function is tucked safely inside the <span class="literal">Math</span> object, we don’t have to worry about overwriting it.</p>
        <p class="indent">Many languages will stop you, or at least warn you, when you are defining a binding with a name that is already taken. JavaScript does this for bindings you declared with <span class="literal">let</span> or <span class="literal">const</span> but—perversely—not for standard bindings nor for bindings declared with <span class="literal">var</span> or <span class="literal">function</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Back to the <span class="literal">Math</span> object. If you need to do trigonometry, <span class="literal">Math</span> can help. It contains <span class="literal">cos</span> (cosine), <span class="literal">sin</span> (sine), and <span class="literal">tan</span> (tangent), as well as their inverse functions, <span class="literal">acos</span>, <span class="literal">asin</span>, and <span class="literal">atan</span>, respectively. The number <em>π</em> (pi)—or at least the closest approximation that fits in a JavaScript number—is available as <span class="literal">Math.PI</span>. There is an old programming tradition of writing the names of constant values in all caps.</p>
        <p class="programs">function randomPointOnCircle(radius) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;let angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return {x: radius * Math.cos(angle),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y: radius * Math.sin(angle)};<br>}<br>console.log(randomPointOnCircle(2));<br>// → {x: 0.3667, y: 1.966}</p>
        <p class="indent">If sines and cosines are not something you are familiar with, don’t worry. When they are used in this book, in <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>, I’ll explain them.</p>
        <p class="indent">The previous example used <span class="literal">Math.random</span>. This is a function that returns a new pseudorandom number between zero (inclusive) and one (exclusive) every time you call it.</p>
        <p class="programs"><br>console.log(Math.random());<br>// → 0.36993729369714856<br>console.log(Math.random());<br>// → 0.727367032552138<br>console.log(Math.random());<br>// → 0.40180766698904335</p>
        <p class="indent">Though computers are deterministic machines—they always react the same way if given the same input—it is possible to have them produce <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"></span>numbers that appear random. To do that, the machine keeps some hidden value, and whenever you ask for a new random number, it performs complicated computations on this hidden value to create a new value. It stores a new value and returns some number derived from it. That way, it can produce ever new, hard-to-predict numbers in a way that <em>seems</em> random.</p>
        <p class="indent">If we want a whole random number instead of a fractional one, we can use <span class="literal">Math.floor</span> (which rounds down to the nearest whole number) on the result of <span class="literal">Math.random</span>.</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));<br>// → 2</p>
        <p class="indent">Multiplying the random number by 10 gives us a number greater than or equal to 0 and below 10. Since <span class="literal">Math.floor</span> rounds down, this expression will produce, with equal chance, any number from 0 through 9.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are also the functions <span class="literal">Math.ceil</span> (for “ceiling,” which rounds up to a whole number), <span class="literal">Math.round</span> (to the nearest whole number), and <span class="literal">Math.abs</span>, which takes the absolute value of a number, meaning it negates negative values but leaves positive ones as they are.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev15">Destructuring</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Let’s go back to the <span class="literal">phi</span> function for a moment.</p>
        <p class="programs">function phi(table) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return (table[3] * table[0] - table[2] * table[1]) /<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Math.sqrt((table[2] + table[3]) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(table[0] + table[1]) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(table[1] + table[3]) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(table[0] + table[2]));<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">One of the reasons this function is awkward to read is that we have a binding pointing at our array, but we’d much prefer to have bindings for the <em>elements</em> of the array, that is, <span class="literal">let n00 = table[0]</span> and so on. Fortunately, there is a succinct way to do this in JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="programs">function phi([n00, n01, n10, n11]) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return (n11 * n00 - n10 * n01) /<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Math.sqrt((n10 + n11) * (n00 + n01) *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n01 + n11) * (n00 + n10));<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">This also works for bindings created with <span class="literal">let</span>, <span class="literal">var</span>, or <span class="literal">const</span>. If you know the value you are binding is an array, you can use square brackets to “look inside” of the value, binding its contents.</p>
        <p class="indent">A similar trick works for objects, using braces instead of square brackets.</p>
        <p class="programs"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"></span>let {name} = {name: "Faraji", age: 23};<br>console.log(name);<br>// → Faraji</p>
        <p class="indent">Note that if you try to destructure <span class="literal">null</span> or <span class="literal">undefined</span>, you get an error, much as you would if you directly try to access a property of those values.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev16">JSON</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Because properties only grasp their value, rather than contain it, objects and arrays are stored in the computer’s memory as sequences of bits holding the <em>addresses</em>—the place in memory—of their contents. So an array with another array inside of it consists of (at least) one memory region for the inner array, and another for the outer array, containing (among other things) a binary number that represents the position of the inner array.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you want to save data in a file for later or send it to another computer over the network, you have to somehow convert these tangles of memory addresses to a description that can be stored or sent. You <em>could</em> send over your entire computer memory along with the address of the value you’re interested in, I suppose, but that doesn’t seem like the best approach.</p>
        <p class="indent">What we can do is <em>serialize</em> the data. That means it is converted into a flat description. A popular serialization format is called <em>JSON</em> (pronounced “Jason”), which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is widely used as a data storage and communication format on the web, even in languages other than JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="indent">JSON looks similar to JavaScript’s way of writing arrays and objects, with a few restrictions. All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowed—no function calls, bindings, or anything that involves actual computation. Comments are not allowed in JSON.</p>
        <p class="indent">A journal entry might look like this when represented as JSON data:</p>
        <p class="programs">{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"squirrel": false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"events": ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]<br>}</p>
        <p class="indent">JavaScript gives us the functions <span class="literal">JSON.stringify</span> and <span class="literal">JSON.parse</span> to convert data to and from this format. The first takes a JavaScript value and returns a JSON-encoded string. The second takes such a string and converts it to the value it encodes.</p>
        <p class="programs">let string = JSON.stringify({squirrel: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events: ["weekend"]});<br>console.log(string);<br>// → {"squirrel":false,"events":["weekend"]}<br>console.log(JSON.parse(string).events);<br>// → ["weekend"]</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev17"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"></span>Summary</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Objects and arrays (which are a specific kind of object) provide ways to group several values into a single value. Conceptually, this allows us to put a bunch of related things in a bag and run around with the bag, instead of wrapping our arms around all of the individual things and trying to hold on to them separately.</p>
        <p class="indent">Most values in JavaScript have properties, the exceptions being <span class="literal">null</span> and <span class="literal">undefined</span>. Properties are accessed using <span class="literal">value.prop</span> or <span class="literal">value["prop"]</span>. Objects tend to use names for their properties and store more or less a fixed set of them. Arrays, on the other hand, usually contain varying amounts of conceptually identical values and use numbers (starting from 0) as the names of their properties.</p>
        <p class="indent">There <em>are</em> some named properties in arrays, such as <span class="literal">length</span> and a number of methods. Methods are functions that live in properties and (usually) act on the value they are a property of.</p>
        <p class="indent">You can iterate over arrays using a special kind of <span class="literal">for</span> loop—<span class="literal">for (let element of array)</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev18">Exercises</h3>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev19"><em>The Sum of a Range</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:</p>
        <p class="programs">console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));</p>
        <p class="indent">Write a <span class="literal">range</span> function that takes two arguments, <span class="literal">start</span> and <span class="literal">end</span>, and returns an array containing all the numbers from <span class="literal">start</span> up to (and including) <span class="literal">end</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Next, write a <span class="literal">sum</span> function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.</p>
        <p class="indent">As a bonus assignment, modify your <span class="literal">range</span> function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call <span class="literal">range(1, 10, 2)</span> should return <span class="literal">[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</span>. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that <span class="literal">range(5, 2, -1)</span> produces <span class="literal">[5, 4, 3, 2]</span>.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev20"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79"></span><em>Reversing an Array</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Arrays have a <span class="literal">reverse</span> method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, <span class="literal">reverseArray</span> and <span class="literal">reverseArrayInPlace</span>. The first, <span class="literal">reverseArray</span>, takes an array as argument and produces a <em>new</em> array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, <span class="literal">reverseArrayInPlace</span>, does what the <span class="literal">reverse</span> method does: it <em>modifies</em> the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard <span class="literal">reverse</span> method.</p>
        <p class="indent">Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in “Functions and Side Effects” on <a href="ch03.xhtml#page_54">page 54</a>, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one runs faster?</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev21"><em>A List</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common data structure is the <em>list</em> (not to be confused with array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.</p>
        <p class="programs">let list = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; value: 1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; rest: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value: 2,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value: 3,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest: null<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>};</p>
        <p class="indent">The resulting objects form a chain, like this:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492071198/files/images/f0079-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="487" height="91"></div>
        <p class="indent">A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For example, if I create two new values <span class="literal">{value: 0, rest: list}</span> and <span class="literal">{value: -1, rest: list}</span> (with <span class="literal">list</span> referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their last three elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.</p>
        <p class="indent">Write a function <span class="literal">arrayToList</span> that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given <span class="literal">[1, 2, 3]</span> as argument. Also write a <span class="literal">listToArray</span> function that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function <span class="literal">prepend</span>, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and <span class="literal">nth</span>, which takes a list and a number <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80"></span>and returns the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or <span class="literal">undefined</span> when there is no such element.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you haven’t already, also write a recursive version of <span class="literal">nth</span>.</p>
        <h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev22"><em>Deep Comparison</em></h4>
        <p class="noindent">The <span class="literal">==</span> operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes you’d prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.</p>
        <p class="indent">Write a function <span class="literal">deepEqual</span> that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to <span class="literal">deepEqual</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the <span class="literal">===</span> operator for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the <span class="literal">typeof</span> operator. If it produces <span class="literal">"object"</span> for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical accident, <span class="literal">typeof null</span> also produces <span class="literal">"object"</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">The <span class="literal">Object.keys</span> function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of objects to compare them.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"></span></p>
